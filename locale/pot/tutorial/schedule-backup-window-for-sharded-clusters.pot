msgid "However, when creating backups from a sharded cluster it is important that you disable the balancer while taking backups to ensure that no chunk migrations affect the content of the backup captured by the backup procedure. Using the procedure outlined in the section :ref:`sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily` you can manually stop the balancer process temporarily. As an alternative, you can use the following procedure to define a balancing window so that the balancer is always disabled during your automated backup operation."

Ensure that the backup can complete outside the window when the balancer is running *and* that the balancer can effectively balance the collection among the shards in the window allotted to each."
