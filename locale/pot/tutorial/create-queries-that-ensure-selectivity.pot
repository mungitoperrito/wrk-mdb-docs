msgid "Selectivity is the ability of a query to narrow results using the index. Effective indexes are more selective and allow MongoDB to use the index for a larger portion of the work associated with fulfilling the query."

# 234a67145fb24d7f9f152e6ba33af6c9
msgid "Suppose you have a field called ``status`` where the possible values are ``new`` and ``processed``. If you add an index on ``status`` you've created a low-selectivity index. The index will be of little help in locating records."

# efe912c46b954e4a8128eea5bd9bdda4
msgid "A better strategy, depending on your queries, would be to create a :ref:`compound index <index-type-compound>` that includes the low-selectivity field and another field. For example, you could create a compound index on ``status`` and ``created_at.``"

msgid "If you query for ``{ a: 2, b: \"no\" }`` MongoDB must scan 3 :term:`documents <document>` in the collection to return the one matching result. Similarly, a query for ``{ a: { $gt: 1}, b: \"tv\" }`` must scan 6 documents, also to return one result."

msgid "If you query for ``{ a: 2, b: \"cd\" }``, MongoDB must scan only one document to fulfill the query. The index and query are more selective because the values of ``a`` are evenly distributed *and* the query can select a specific document using the index."
