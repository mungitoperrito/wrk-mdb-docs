msgid "The default chunk size for a sharded cluster is 64 megabytes. This default chunk size works well for most deployments; however, if you notice that automatic migrations have more I/O than your hardware can handle, you may want to reduce the chunk size. For automatic splits and migrations, a small chunk size leads to more rapid and frequent migrations. The allowed range of the chunk size is between 1 and 1024 megabytes, inclusive."
