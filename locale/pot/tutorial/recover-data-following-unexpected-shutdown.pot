msgid "Generally, you should not manually remove the ``mongod.lock`` file. Instead, use the above procedure to recover the database. In dire situations, you can remove the file, start the database using the possibly corrupt files, and attempt to recover data from the database. However, it is impossible to predict the state of the database in these situations."
