The :program:`mongos` instance splits and manages chunks automatically, but for exceptional circumstances the :dbcommand:`split` command does allow administrators to manually create splits. See :doc:`/tutorial/split-chunks-in-sharded-cluster` for information on these circumstances, and on the MongoDB shell commands that wrap :dbcommand:`split`."

msgid "Be careful when splitting data in a sharded collection to create new chunks. When you shard a collection that has existing data, MongoDB automatically creates chunks to evenly distribute the collection. To split data effectively in a sharded cluster you must consider the number of documents in a chunk and the average document size to create a uniform chunk size. When chunks have irregular sizes, shards may have an equal number of chunks but have very different data sizes. Avoid creating splits that lead to a collection with differently sized chunks."
