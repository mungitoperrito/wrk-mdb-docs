Instead of disabling the balloon driver and memory overcommitment features, map and reserve the full amount of memory for the virtual machine running MongoDB.

When memory is overcommitted, the hypervisor reallocates memory between the virtual machines. KVM's balloon driver  reclaims the pages that are considered least valuable. The balloon driver resides inside the guest operating system. When the balloon driver expands, it may induce the guest operating system to reclaim memory from guest applications, which can interfere with MongoDB's memory management and affect MongoDB's performance."
