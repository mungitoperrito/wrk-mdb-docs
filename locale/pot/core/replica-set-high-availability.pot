msgid "MongoDB introduces a version 1 of the replication protocol (:rsconf:`protocolVersion: 1 <protocolVersion>`) to reduce replica set failover time and accelerates the detection of multiple simultaneous primaries. New replica sets will, by default, use :rsconf:`protocolVersion: 1 <protocolVersion>`. Previous versions of MongoDB use version 0 of the protocol."
