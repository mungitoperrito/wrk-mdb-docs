msgid "Delayed members contain copies of a :term:`replica set's <replica set>` data set. However, a delayed member's data set reflects an earlier, or delayed, state of the set. For example, if the current time is 09:52 and a member has a delay of an hour, the delayed member has no operation more recent than 08:52."

msgid "Because delayed members are a \"rolling backup\" or a running \"historical\" snapshot of the data set, they may help you recover from various kinds of human error. For example, a delayed member can make it possible to recover from unsuccessful application upgrades and operator errors including dropped databases and collections."
