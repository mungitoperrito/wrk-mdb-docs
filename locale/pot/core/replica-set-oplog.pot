msgid "The :term:`oplog` (operations log) is a special :term:`capped collection` that keeps a rolling record of all operations that modify the data stored in your databases. MongoDB applies database operations on the :term:`primary` and then records the operations on the primary's oplog. The :term:`secondary` members then copy and apply these operations in an asynchronous process. All replica set members contain a copy of the oplog, in the :data:`local.oplog.rs` collection, which allows them to maintain the current state of the database."
