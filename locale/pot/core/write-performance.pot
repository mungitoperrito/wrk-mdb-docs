msgid "For each :dbcommand:`insert` or :dbcommand:`delete` write operation on a collection, MongoDB either inserts or removes the corresponding document keys from each index in the target collection.

msgid "On :program:`mongod` instances that use the :ref:`MMAPv1 <storage-mmapv1>` storage engine, update operations may cause a document to grow beyond its allocated space. When a document outgrows its allocated space, MMAPv1 moves the document to a new location on disk, and must update each index on the collection to point to the new document location. These move operations can be expensive but occur infrequently."

msgid "In general, the performance gains that indexes provide for *read operations* are worth the insertion penalty. However, in order to optimize write performance when possible, be careful when creating new indexes and evaluate the existing indexes to ensure that your queries actually use these indexes."

msgid "For the MMAPv1 storage engine, if an update operation causes a document to exceed the currently allocated :term:`record size`, MongoDB relocates the document on disk with enough contiguous space to hold the document. Updates that require relocations take longer than updates that do not, particularly if the collection has indexes. If a collection has indexes, MongoDB must update all index entries. Thus, for a collection with many indexes, the move will impact the write throughput."

msgid "By default, MongoDB uses :ref:`power-of-2-allocation` to add :ref:`padding automatically <record-allocation-strategies>` for the MMAPv1 storage engine. The :ref:`power-of-2-allocation` ensures that MongoDB allocates document space in sizes that are powers of 2, which helps ensure that MongoDB can efficiently reuse free space created by document deletion or relocation as well as reduce the occurrences of reallocations in many cases."

Decreasing the period between journal commits will increase the number of write operations, which can limit MongoDB's capacity for write operations. Increasing the amount of time between journal commits may decrease the total number of write operation, but also increases the chance that the journal will not record a write operation in the event of a failure."
