msgid "MongoDB can use any valid SSL certificate issued by a certificate authority or a self-signed certificate. If you use a self-signed certificate, although the communications channel will be encrypted, there will be *no* validation of server identity. Although such a situation will prevent eavesdropping on the connection, it leaves you vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack. Using a certificate signed by a trusted certificate authority will permit MongoDB drivers to verify the server's identity."
