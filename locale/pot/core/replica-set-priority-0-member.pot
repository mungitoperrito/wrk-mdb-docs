msgid "A *priority 0* member is a secondary that **cannot** become :term:`primary`. *Priority 0* members cannot *trigger* :term:`elections <election>`.  Otherwise these members function as normal secondaries. A *priority 0* member maintains a copy of the data set, accepts read operations, and votes in elections. Configure a *priority 0* member to prevent :term:`secondaries <secondary>` from becoming primary, which is particularly useful in multi-data center deployments."
