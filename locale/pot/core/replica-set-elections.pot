msgid ":term:`Replica sets <replica set>` use elections to determine which set member will become :term:`primary`. Elections occur after initiating a replica set, and also any time the primary becomes unavailable. The primary is the only member in the set that can accept write operations. If a primary becomes unavailable, elections allow the set to recover normal operations without manual intervention. In the following three-member replica set, the primary is unavailable. One of the remaining secondaries holds an election to elect itself as a new primary."

The replica set cannot accept writes after this occurs, but remaining members can continue to serve read queries if such queries are configured to run on secondaries."

msgid "After a replica set has a stable primary, the election algorithm will make a \"best-effort\" attempt to have the secondary with the highest :rsconf:`~members[n].priority` available call an election. Member priority affects both the timing and the outcome of elections; secondaries with higher priority call elections relatively sooner than secondaries with lower priority, and are also more likely to win. However, a lower priority instance can be elected as primary for brief periods, even if a higher priority secondary is available. Replica set members continue to call elections until the highest priority member available becomes primary."
