msgid "By default, MongoDB will automatically close a cursor when the client has exhausted all results in the cursor. However, for :doc:`capped collections </core/capped-collections>` you may use a *Tailable Cursor* that remains open after the client exhausts the results in the initial cursor. Tailable cursors are conceptually equivalent to the ``tail`` Unix command with the ``-f`` option (i.e. with \"follow\" mode). After clients insert new additional documents into a capped collection, the tailable cursor will continue to retrieve documents."

msgid "If your query is on an indexed field, do not use tailable cursors, but instead, use a regular cursor. Keep track of the last value of the indexed field returned by the query. To retrieve the newly added documents, query the collection again using the last value of the indexed field in the query criteria, as in the following example:"
