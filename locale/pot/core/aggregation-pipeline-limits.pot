msgid "Starting in MongoDB 2.6, the :dbcommand:`aggregate` command can return a cursor or store the results in a collection. When returning a cursor or storing the results in a collection, each document in the result set is subject to the :limit:`BSON Document Size` limit, currently 16 megabytes; if any single document that exceeds the :limit:`BSON Document Size` limit, the command will produce an error. The limit only applies to the returned documents; during the pipeline processing, the documents may exceed this size. The :program:`db.collection.aggregate()` method returns a cursor by default starting in MongoDB 2.6"
