description: |
   A document that specifies the fields to include in
   the output documents in addition to the ``_id`` field. To
   specify the field to include, you must use :ref:`accumulator
   expressions <agg-quick-reference-accumulators>`:
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
      
      <outputfield1>: { <accumulator>: <expression1> },
      ...
   
   The default ``count`` field is not included in the output document 
   when ``output`` is specified. Explicitly specify the ``count`` 
   expression as part of the ``output`` document to include it:
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
      
      output: { 
        <outputfield1>: { <accumulator>: <expression1> },
        ...
        count: { $sum: 1 }
