  You can specify a query expression on any of the :ref:`fields
  returned <list-collection-output>` by {{role}}.

description: |
   A flag to indicate whether the command should return just the
   collection/view names and type or return both the name and other information.

   Returning just the name and type (``view`` or ``collection``) does
   not take collection-level locks whereas returning full collection
   information locks each collection in the database.
    

   The default value is ``false``.
