  If your MongoDB deployment uses SSL, you must also specify the ``--host`` option.
  {{program}} verifies that the
  hostname of the {{instance}} to which you are connecting matches
  the CN or SAN of the {{instance}}'s ``--sslPEMKeyFile`` certificate.
  If the hostname does not match the CN/SAN, {{program}} will fail to
  connect.
