ref: changestream-resume

   Unlike the MongoDB :ecosystem:`drivers </drivers>`, the
   :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell does not automatically attempt to resume a
   change stream cursor after an error. The MongoDB drivers make *one*
   attempt to automatically resume a change stream cursor after certain
   errors.

   If the operation identified by the resume token passed to the
   ``resumeAfter`` option has already dropped off the :term:`oplog`,
   |watchmethod| cannot resume the change stream.

   |watchmethod| uses information stored in the oplog
   to produce the change event
   description and generate a resume token associated to that operation. If
   enough time has passed such that the data changing operation which
   generated the resume token is no longer present in the oplog, you cannot
   use that token to resume the change stream.

   See :ref:`change-stream-resume` for complete documentation on
   resuming a change stream.

ref: changestream-full-document-lookup

   By default, the :ref:`change stream cursor <changeStreams>` returns
   specific field changes/deltas for update operations. You can also
   configure the change stream to look up and return the current
   majority-committed version of the changed document. Depending on other
   write operations that may have occurred between the update and the
   lookup, the returned document may differ significantly from the
   document at the time of the update.

   Depending on the number of changes applied during the update operation
   and the size of the full document, there is a risk that the size of the
   change event document for an update operation is greater than the 16MB
   BSON document limit. If this occurs, the server closes the change stream
   cursor and returns an error.
