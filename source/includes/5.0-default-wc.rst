Starting in MongoDB 5.0, the implicit default write concern is
:writeconcern:`w: majority <"majority">`. However, special
considerations are made for deployments containing :ref:`arbiters
<replica-set-arbiter-configuration>`:

- If the number of data-bearing voting members is not strictly more
  than the voting majority, the default write concern is ``w: 1``.

- In all other scenarios, the default write concern is ``w:
  "majority"``.

Specifically, MongoDB uses the following formula to determine the
default write concern:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   if [(#arbiters > 0) AND (#arbiters >= Â½(#voting nodes) - 1)]
       defaultWriteConcern = { w: 1 }
   else
       defaultWriteConcern = { w: majority }
