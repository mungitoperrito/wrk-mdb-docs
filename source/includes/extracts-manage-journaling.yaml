  MongoDB uses *write ahead logging* to an on-disk :term:`journal` to
  guarantee :doc:`write operation </crud>` durability.
  
  The WiredTiger storage engine does not require journaling to guarantee
  a consistent state after a crash. The database will be restored to the
  last consistent :ref:`checkpoint <storage-wiredtiger-checkpoints>`
  during recovery.  However, if MongoDB exits unexpectedly in between
  checkpoints, journaling is required to recover writes that occurred
  after the last checkpoint.

  .. note::

     .. include:: /includes/wiredtiger-node-nojournal.rst

  With journaling enabled, if :binary:`~bin.mongod` stops unexpectedly, the
  program can recover everything written to the journal. MongoDB will
  re-apply the write operations on restart and maintain a consistent
  state. By default, the greatest extent of lost writes, i.e., those not
  made to the journal, are those made in the last 100 milliseconds, plus
  the time it takes to perform the actual journal writes. See
  :setting:`~storage.journal.commitIntervalMs` for more information on
  the default.

  Disable Journaling
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  .. warning::

     Do not disable journaling on production systems. 

     - .. include:: /includes/wiredtiger-node-nojournal.rst


  To disable journaling, start :binary:`~bin.mongod` with the
  :option:`--nojournal <mongod --nojournal>` command line option.

  Get Commit Acknowledgement
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  You can get commit acknowledgement with the :ref:`write-concern` and
  the :writeconcern:`j` option. For details, see
  :ref:`write-concern-operation`.

  Monitor Journal Status
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Use the following command to monitor journal status:

  - :dbcommand:`serverStatus`

    The :dbcommand:`serverStatus` command returns database status
    information that is useful for assessing performance.

ref: journaling-recover-data-unexpected-shutdown

  Recover Data After Unexpected Shutdown
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  On a restart after a crash, MongoDB replays all journal files in the
  journal directory before the server becomes available. If MongoDB must
  replay journal files, :binary:`~bin.mongod` notes these events in the log
  output.

  There is no reason to run :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` in these
  situations.
