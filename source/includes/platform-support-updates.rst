Starting in MongoDB 8.0, new MongoDB Server versions (major and minor)
support the minimum operating system (OS) minor version defined by the
OS vendor. After an OS minor version is no longer supported by the OS
vendor, MongoDB updates the MongoDB Server to support the next OS minor
version. For details, see `MongoDB Platform Support Improvements
<https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/announcing-mongodb-server-8-0-platform-support-improvements>`_.
