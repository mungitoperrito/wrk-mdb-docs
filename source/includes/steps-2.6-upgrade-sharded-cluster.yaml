  Start a single 2.6 :program:`mongos` instance with
  the :setting:`~sharding.configDB` pointing to the cluster's config servers and with
  the ``--upgrade`` option.

  To run a :program:`mongos` with the ``--upgrade`` option, you
  can upgrade an existing :program:`mongos` instance to 2.6, or if you
  need to avoid reconfiguring a production :program:`mongos` instance,
  you can use a new 2.6 :program:`mongos` that can reach all the config
  servers.
action:
  pre: "To upgrade the meta data, run:"
  language: sh
  code: |
    mongos --configdb <configDB string> --upgrade
  post: |
    You can include the :option:`--logpath <mongos --logpath>` option
    to output the log messages to a file instead of the standard
    output. Also include any other options required to start
    :program:`mongos` instances in your cluster, such as
    :option:`--sslOnNormalPorts <mongos --sslOnNormalPorts>` or
    :option:`--sslPEMKeyFile <mongos --sslPEMKeyFile>`.


    The :program:`mongos` will exit upon completion of the
    ``--upgrade`` process.

  The upgrade will prevent any chunk moves or splits from occurring
  during the upgrade process. If the data files have many sharded
  collections or if failed processes hold stale locks,
  acquiring the locks for all collections can take
  seconds or minutes. Watch the log for progress updates.

  character: "'"
stepnum: 3
ref: ensure-mongos-upgrade-complete
pre: |
   The :program:`mongos` will exit upon completion of the meta data
   upgrade process. If successful, the process will log the following
   messages:
action:
  language: sh
  code: |
      upgrade of config server to v5 successful
      Config database is at version v5
post: |
  After a successful upgrade, restart the :program:`mongos` instance.
  If :program:`mongos` fails to start, check the log for more
  information.

  If the :program:`mongos` instance loses its connection to the config
  servers during the upgrade or if the upgrade is otherwise
  unsuccessful, you may always safely retry the upgrade.

  Upgrade and restart **without** the ``--upgrade`` option the
  other :program:`mongos` instances in the sharded cluster. After
  upgrading all the :program:`mongos`, see
  :ref:`2.6-finalize-shard-cluster-upgrade` for information on
  upgrading the other cluster components.
