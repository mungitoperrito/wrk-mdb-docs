  To repair the data files, start the :program:`mongod` instance with
  the :option:`--repair` option. By default, during the repair
  operation, MongoDB uses a ``_tmp`` directory in the
  :option:`--dbpath`. 
  
  If the :program:`mongod` instance uses :doc:`/core/mmapv1`, you can
  include the :option:`--repairpath` option to specify an alternate
  temporary directory. For details, see :option:`--repairpath`.

  Issue a command similar to the following:
     
action:
  language: sh
