   .. versionchanged:: 4.0.2

      If the parameter :parameter:`enableElectionHandoff` is true
      (default), when a primary steps down from :method:`rs.stepDown()`
      (or the :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` command without the ``force:
      true``), the stepped-down primary nominates an eligible secondary
      to call an election immediately. Otherwise, secondaries can wait
      up to :rsconf:`settings.electionTimeoutMillis` before calling an
      election. The stepped down primary does not wait for the effects
      of the handoff. For more information, see
      :parameter:`enableElectionHandoff`.
