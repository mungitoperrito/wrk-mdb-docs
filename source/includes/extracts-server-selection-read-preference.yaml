      * - Read Preference
        - Selection Process

      * - :readmode:`primary` (Default)

        - #. The {{actor}} selects the primary.

      * - :readmode:`secondary`

        - #. The {{actor}} assembles a list of eligible secondary members.
             :doc:`Tag sets </tutorial/configure-replica-set-tag-sets>`
             and :doc:`read concern </reference/read-concern>` can further
             restrict the eligibility of the members.

             .. COMMENT To DocsTeam: 
                In 3.4, will have maxStalenessMS which we'll need to  add here.

          #. If the list of eligible members is not empty, the {{actor}}
             determines which eligible member is the "closest" (i.e. the
             member with the lowest average network round-trip-time) and
             calculates a latency window by adding the average
             round-trip-time of this "closest" server and the
             {{threshold}}. The  {{actor}} uses this latency window to
             pare down the list of eligible members to those members that
             fall within this window.

          #. From this list of eligible members that fall within the
             latency window, the  {{actor}} randomly chooses an eligible member.

      * - :readmode:`nearest`

        - #. The {{actor}} assembles a list of eligible members (primary and
             secondaries). :doc:`Tag sets
             </tutorial/configure-replica-set-tag-sets>` and :ref:`read
             concern</reference/read-concern>` can further limit the
             eligibility of the members.

             members is non-empty, {{actor}} chooses an eligible secondary member.
