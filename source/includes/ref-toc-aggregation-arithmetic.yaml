name: :expression:`$add`
file: /reference/operator/aggregation/add
description: |
  Adds numbers to return the sum, or adds numbers and a date to return
  a new date. If adding numbers and a date, treats the numbers as
  milliseconds. Accepts any number of argument expressions, but at
  most, one expression can resolve to a date.
---
name: :expression:`$ceil`
description: |
   Returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the specified number.
file: /reference/operator/aggregation/ceil
---
name: :expression:`$divide`
file: /reference/operator/aggregation/divide
description: |
  Returns the result of dividing the first number by the second. Accepts
  two argument expressions.
---
name: :expression:`$exp`
description: Raises *e* to the specified exponent.
file: /reference/operator/aggregation/exp
---
name: :expression:`$floor`
description: |
   Returns the largest integer less than or equal to the specified number.

name: :expression:`$log10`
description: Calculates the log base 10 of a number.
file: /reference/operator/aggregation/log10
---
name: :expression:`$mod`
file: /reference/operator/aggregation/mod
description: |
  Returns the remainder of the first number divided by the second.
  Accepts two argument expressions.
---
name: :expression:`$multiply`
file: /reference/operator/aggregation/multiply
description: |
  Multiplies numbers to return the product. Accepts any number of
  argument expressions.
---
name: :expression:`$pow`
description: Raises a number to the specified exponent.
file: /reference/operator/aggregation/pow
---
name: :expression:`$sqrt`
description: |
   Calculates the square root.
file: /reference/operator/aggregation/sqrt
---
name: :expression:`$subtract`
file: /reference/operator/aggregation/subtract
description: |
  Returns the result of subtracting the second value from the first. If
  the two values are numbers, return the difference. If the two values
  are dates, return the difference in milliseconds. If the two values
  are a date and a number in milliseconds, return the resulting date.
  Accepts two argument expressions. If the two values are a date and a
  number, specify the date argument first as it is not meaningful to
  subtract a date from a number.
