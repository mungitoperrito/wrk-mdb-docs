At this point, you can run the |newversion| binaries without the
|newversion| :ref:`features that are incompatible
<3.4-compatibility-enabled>` with |oldversion|.

To enable these |newversion| features, set the feature compatibility
version to |newversion|.

.. warning::

   Enabling these backwards-incompatible features can :ref:`complicate
   the downgrade process <3.4-downgrade-features-prereq>`. For details,
   see :ref:`3.4-downgrade-features-prereq`.

   It is recommended that after upgrading, you allow your deployment to
   run without enabling these features for a burn-in period to ensure
   the likelihood of downgrade is minimal. When you are confident that
   the likelihood of downgrade is minimal, enable these features.
