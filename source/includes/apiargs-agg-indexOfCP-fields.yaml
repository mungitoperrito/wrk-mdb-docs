   Can be any valid :ref:`expression <aggregation-expressions>` as long
   as it resolves to a string. For more information on expressions, see
   :ref:`aggregation-expressions`.

   If the string expression resolves to a value of ``null`` or refers
   to a field that is missing, :expression:`$indexOfCP` returns
   ``null``.

   If the string expression does not resolve to a string or ``null``
   nor refers to a missing field, :expression:`$indexOfCP` returns an
   error.

   An integer, or a number that can be represented as integers (such as
   2.0), that specifies the starting index position for the search. Can
   be any valid :ref:`expression <aggregation-expressions>` that
   resolves to a non-negative integral number.

   If unspecified, the starting index position for the search is the
   beginning of the string.

   An integer, or a number that can be represented as integers (such as
   2.0), that specifies the ending index position for the search. Can
   be any valid :ref:`expression <aggregation-expressions>` that
   resolves to a non-negative integral number. If you specify a
   ``<end>`` index value, you should also specify a ``<start>`` index
   value; otherwise, :expression:`$indexOfCP` uses the ``<end>`` value
   as the ``<start>`` index value instead of the ``<end>`` value.

   If unspecified, the ending index position for the search is the
   end of the string.
