  Using either a package manager or a manual download, get the latest
  release in the |oldversion| series. If using a package manager, add a new
  repository for the |oldversion| binaries, then perform the actual downgrade
  process.

  Downgrade each :term:`secondary` member of the replica set, one at a
  time:

  a. Shut down the :binary:`~bin.mongod`.

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.adminCommand( { shutdown: 1 } )

  #. Replace the |newversion| binary with the |oldversion| binary and        restart.

  #. Wait for the member to recover to ``SECONDARY`` state
     before downgrading the next secondary. To check the member's state,
     use the :method:`rs.status()` method in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell.

  #. Once the member is in ``SECONDARY`` stage, downgrade the next
     secondary.

pre: |
  Use :method:`rs.stepDown()` in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to
  step down the :term:`primary` and force the normal :ref:`failover
  <replica-set-failover>` procedure.
action:
  language: javascript
  code:
    rs.stepDown()
post: |
  :method:`rs.stepDown()` expedites the failover procedure and is
  preferable to shutting down the primary directly.

ref: 4.4-downgrade-primary
content: |
   When :method:`rs.status()` shows that the primary has stepped down
   and another member has assumed ``PRIMARY`` state:
     
   a. Shut down the previous primary.

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.adminCommand( { shutdown: 1 } )

   b. Replace the :binary:`~bin.mongod` binary with
      the |oldversion| binary and restart.
