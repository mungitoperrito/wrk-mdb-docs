content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.2, for ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` set to
   ``"4.2"`` or greater, MongoDB removes the :limit:`Index Key Limit`. For
   ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` set to ``"4.0"``, the limit still
   applies. 

   If you have an index with keys that exceed the :limit:`Index Key
   Limit` once ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` is set to ``"4.0"``,
   consider changing the index to a hashed index or to indexing a
   computed value. You can also **temporarily** use
   :parameter:`failIndexKeyTooLong` set to ``false`` before resolving
   the problem. However, withs :parameter:`failIndexKeyTooLong` set to
   ``false``, queries that use these indexes can return incomplete
   results.
