ref: 4.2-downgrade-fcv-index-key
content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.2, for ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` (fCV)
   set to ``"4.2"`` or greater, MongoDB removes the :limit:`Index Key
   Limit`. For fCV set to ``"4.0"``, the limit still applies.

   If you have an index with keys that exceed the :limit:`Index Key
   Limit` once fCV is set to ``"4.0"``,
   consider changing the index to a hashed index or to indexing a
   computed value. You can also **temporarily** use
   :parameter:`failIndexKeyTooLong` set to ``false`` before resolving
   the problem. However, with :parameter:`failIndexKeyTooLong` set to
   ``false``, queries that use these indexes can return incomplete
   results.

   Starting in MongoDB 4.2, for ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` (fCV)
   set to ``"4.2"`` or greater, MongoDB removes the :limit:`Index Key
   Limit`. For fCV set to ``"4.0"``, the limit still applies.

   If you have an index with a name that exceeds the :limit:`Index Name
   Length` once fCV is set to ``"4.0"``,
   drop and recreate the index with a shorter name.
