  When ``true``, ``repairDatabase`` moves old database files to the
  backup directory instead of deleting them before moving new files
  into place. New files are created with the "backup" instead of "_tmp"
  directory prefix. By default, ``repairDatabase`` leaves temporary
  files unchanged, and uses the "_tmp" naming prefix for new files.
