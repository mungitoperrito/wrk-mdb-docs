If you installed MongoDB from the MongoDB ``apt``, ``yum``, ``dnf``, or
``zypper`` repositories, you should upgrade to |newversion| using your package
manager. 

Follow the appropriate :doc:`installation instructions
</administration/install-on-linux>` for your Linux system. This will
involve adding a repository for the new release, then performing the
actual upgrade process.
