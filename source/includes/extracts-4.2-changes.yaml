ref: 4.2-changes-index-names
content: |

     Starting in version 4.2, for :ref:`featureCompatibilityVersion
     <view-fcv>` set to ``"4.2"`` or greater, MongoDB removes the
     :limit:`Index Name Length` limit of 127 byte maximum. In previous
     versions or MongoDB versions with
     :ref:`featureCompatibilityVersion <view-fcv>` (fCV) set to
     ``"4.0"``, index names must fall within the
     :limit:`limit <Index Name Length>`.

   Starting in version 4.2, MongoDB removes the ``limit`` and ``num``
   options for the :pipeline:`$geoNear` stage as well as the default
   limit of 100 documents. To limit the results of
   :pipeline:`$geoNear`, use the :pipeline:`$geoNear` stage with the
   :pipeline:`$limit` stage.

ref: 4.2-changes-passwordPrompt
content: |

   Starting in version 4.2 of the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, you can
   use the :method:`passwordPrompt()` method in conjunction with
   various user authentication/management methods/commands to prompt
   for the password instead of specifying the password directly in the
   method/command call. However, you can still specify the password
   directly as you would with earlier versions of the
   :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell.
