ref: 4.2-changes-index-names
content: |

     Starting in version 4.2, for :ref:`featureCompatibilityVersion
     <view-fcv>` set to ``"4.2"`` or greater, MongoDB removes the
     :limit:`Index Name Length` limit of 127 byte maximum. In previous
     versions or MongoDB versions with
     :ref:`featureCompatibilityVersion <view-fcv>` (fCV) set to
     ``"4.0"``, index names must fall within the
     :limit:`limit <Index Name Length>`.

ref: 4.2-changes-geoNear-limit
content: |

   Starting in version 4.2, MongoDB removes the ``limit`` and ``num``
   options for the :pipeline:`$geoNear` stage as well as the default
   limit of 100 documents. To limit the results of
   :pipeline:`$geoNear`, use the :pipeline:`$geoNear` stage with the
   :pipeline:`$limit` stage.

ref: 4.2-changes-passwordPrompt
content: |

   Starting in version 4.2 of the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, you can
   use the :method:`passwordPrompt()` method in conjunction with
   various user authentication/management methods/commands to prompt
   for the password instead of specifying the password directly in the
   method/command call. However, you can still specify the password
   directly as you would with earlier versions of the
   :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell.

ref: 4.2-changes-opcounters-type
content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.2, the returned opcounters.* values are
   type NumberLong. In previous versions, the values are of type NumberInt.
---
ref: 4.2-changes-opcountersRepl-type
content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.2, the returned opcountersRepl.* values are 
   type NumberLong. In previous versions, the values are type NumberInt.
---
ref: 4.2-changes-out-linearizable
content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.2, the :pipeline:`$out` stage cannot be used
   in conjunction with read concern :readconcern:`"linearizable"`. That
   is, if you specify :readconcern:`"linearizable"` read concern for
   :method:`db.collection.aggregate()`, you cannot include the
   :pipeline:`$out` stage in the pipeline.

ref: 4.2-changes-usedDisk
content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.2, the :doc:`profiler log messages
   </tutorial/manage-the-database-profiler>` and :doc:`diagnostic log
   messages </reference/log-messages>` includes a ``usedDisk``
   indicator if any aggregation stage wrote data to temporary files due
   to :ref:`memory restrictions <agg-memory-restrictions>`.
---
ref: 4.2-changes-keyfile-fmt
content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.2, :ref:`keyfiles for internal membership
   authentication <internal-auth-keyfile>` use YAML format to allow for
   multiple keys in a keyfile. The YAML format accepts content of:

   - a single key string (same as in earlier versions),
   
   - multiple key strings (each string must be enclosed in quotes), or
   
   - sequence of key strings.

   The YAML format is compatible with the existing single-key
   keyfiles that use the text file format.
---
ref: 4.2-changes-slow-oplog-log-message-footnote
content: |

   Starting in version 4.2 (also available starting in 4.0.6), secondary members of a replica set now
   :ref:`log oplog entries <slow-oplog>` that take longer than the slow
   operation threshold to apply. These slow oplog messages are logged
   for the secondaries in the :option:`diagnostic log <mongod
   --logpath>` under the :data:`REPL` component with the text ``applied
   op: <oplog entry> took <num>ms``. These slow oplog entries depend
   only on the slow operation threshold. They do not depend on the log
   levels (either at the system or component level), or the profiling
   level, or the slow operation sample rate. The profiler does not
   capture slow oplog entries.
---
ref: 4.2-changes-type-0
content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.2, users can no longer use the query filter
   ``$type: 0`` as a synonym for
   ``$exists:false``. To query for null or missing fields, see
   :doc:`/tutorial/query-for-null-fields`.
   
---
ref: 4.2-changes-log-storage
content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.2, for slow operations, the :doc:`profiler
   entries </tutorial/manage-the-database-profiler>` and
   :doc:`diagnostic log messages </reference/log-messages>` include
   :data:`~system.profile.storage` information.
