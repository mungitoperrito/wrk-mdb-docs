Downgrade the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` to ``"3.4"``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand({setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "3.4"})

This command must perform writes to an internal system collection.
If for any reason the command does not complete successfully, you
can safely retry the command on the |target| as the operation is
idempotent.
