      Use the following repository file:
    language: cfg
    code: |
      [mongodb-enterprise]
      name=MongoDB Enterprise Repository
      baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.com/yum/redhat/$releasever/mongodb-enterprise/3.6/$basearch/

      ``.repo`` files for each release can also be found `in the repository itself <https://repo.mongodb.com/yum/redhat/>`_.
      Remember that odd-numbered minor release versions (e.g. 3.5) are development versions and are unsuitable
      for production deployment.

      the package by adding the following ``exclude`` directive to your
      ``/etc/yum.conf`` file:
