title: Add the remaining secondary members to the replica set.
stepnum: 5
level: 4
ref: add-members
action:
  pre: |
    Use :method:`rs.add()` in a :program:`mongo` shell connected to the
    current primary. The commands should resemble the following:
  language: javascript
  code: |
    rs.add("mongodb1.example.net")
    rs.add("mongodb2.example.net")
    rs.add("mongodb3.example.net")
post: |
  When complete, you should have a fully functional replica set. The new
  replica set will elect a :term:`primary`.

action:
  pre: |
    In the same shell session, issue the following command to add the
    arbiter (e.g. ``mongodb4.example.net``):
  language: javascript
  code: |
    rs.addArb("mongodb4.example.net")

title: Optional. Configure the member eligibility for becoming primary.
stepnum: 7
level: 4
ref: verify-priority
pre: |
  In some cases, you may prefer that the members in one data center be
  elected primary before the members in the other data centers. You can
  modify the :rsconf:`~members[n].priority` of the members such that the
  members in the one data center has higher
  :rsconf:`~members[n].priority` than the members in the other data
  centers.

  Some members of the replica set, such as members that have networking
  restraint or limited resources, should not be able to become primary
  in a :term:`failover`. Configure members that should not become
  primary to have :ref:`priority 0
  <replica-set-secondary-only-members>`.

  For example, to lower the relative eligibility of the the member
  located in one of the sites (in this example,
  ``mongodb2.example.net``), set the member's priority to ``0.5``.

action:
  - pre: |
      .. include:: /includes/fact-distributed-rs-siteB-config.rst
  - pre: |
      After these commands return, you have a geographically redundant
      five-member replica set.
