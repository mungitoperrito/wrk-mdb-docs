   Views exhibit the following behavior:

   - Views are read-only; write operations on views will error.

   - Views use indexes of the underlying collection.

   - Views are considered sharded if their underlying collection is
     sharded. As such, you cannot specify a sharded view for the
     ``from`` field in :pipeline:`$lookup` and :pipeline:`$graphLookup`
     operations.

   - Views are computed on demand during read operations, and MongoDB
     executes read operations on views as part of the underlying
     aggregation pipeline. As such, views do not support operations
     such as:

     - :method:`db.collection.mapReduce()`,

     - :query:`$text` operator, since ``$text`` operation in
       aggregation is valid only for the first stage,

     - :dbcommand:`geoNear` command and :pipeline:`$geoNear` pipeline stage.

   - If the aggregation pipeline used to create the view suppresses the
     ``_id`` field, documents in the view do not have the ``_id`` field.

   String comparisons on the view use the view's default collation. An
   operation that attempts to change or override a view's default
   collation will fail with an error.
