   Shut down your :program:`mongod` instance. Replace the existing
   binary with the |newversion| :program:`mongod` binary.

   Restart :program:`mongod`. If you wish remote clients to connect to
   the :program:`mongod` instance, you must specify ``--bind_ip`` (or
   the :setting:`net.bindIp` setting). For more information, see
   :ref:`3.6-bind_ip-compatibility`.

      This command must perform writes to an internal system
      collection. If for any reason the command does not complete
      successfully, you can safely retry the command as
      the operation is idempotent.
