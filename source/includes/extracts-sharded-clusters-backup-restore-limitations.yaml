content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.2, :binary:`~bin.mongodump` and
   :binary:`~bin.mongorestore` :red:`cannot` be part of a backup
   strategy for sharded clusters. These manual tools do not maintain
   the atomicity guarantees of transactions across shards.

   To maintain the atomicity guarantees of transactions across shards,
   use the coordinated backup and restore services provided by:

   - `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?jmp=docs>`_,

   - `MongoDB Cloud Manager
     <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/cloud-manager?jmp=docs>`_, or
   
   - `MongoDB Ops Manager
     <https://www.mongodb.com/products/ops-manager?jmp=docs>`_.
