  .. versionchanged:: 4.4

    :binary:`~bin.mongod` / :binary:`~bin.mongos` logs a warning on
    connection if the presented x.509 certificate expires within ``30``
    days of the ``mongod/mongos`` host system time. See
    :ref:`4.4-rel-notes-certificate-expiration-warning` for more
    information.

ref: 4.4-validate-options
content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, for the WiredTiger storage engine, you can
   run the :dbcommand:`validate` command in the background or in the
   foreground. In earlier versions, you can only run
   :dbcommand:`validate` in the foreground:

   - When run in |background|, the operation takes an intent shared
     lock on the collection and does not block reads and writes or DDL
     operations on the collection; however, the operation does not
     update collection count and size metrics.
 
   - When run in |foreground|, the operation takes an exclusive lock on
     the collection and blocks all reads and writes and DDL operations
     on the collection until the operation finishes. When run on a
     secondary, the operation can block all other operations on that
     secondary until it finishes.

   the user is prompted to enter a password.

ref: 4.4-changes-removed-commands
content: |
   MongoDB removes the following command(s) and :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
   helper(s):

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 25 55
   
      * - Removed Command
        - Removed Helper
        - Alternatives
     
      * - ``cloneCollection``
   
        - ``db.cloneCollection()``

        - - Use :binary:`~bin.mongoexport` and
            :binary:`~bin.mongoimport`, or

          - Use the aggregation pipeline :pipeline:`$out` or
            :pipeline:`$merge` stages, or
 
          - Write a script using the drivers.

      * - ``planCacheListPlans``
   
        - ``PlanCache.getPlansByQuery()``

        - - Use the aggregation pipeline stage :pipeline:`$planCacheStats` or

          - Use the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell helper method
            :method:`PlanCache.list()`. (Available starting in version 4.4)

          | See also :ref:`4.4-agg-planCachesStats-changes`.

      * - ``planCacheListQueryShapes``

        - ``PlanCache.listQueryShapes()``

        - - Use the aggregation pipeline stage :pipeline:`$planCacheStats` or
 
          - Use the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell helper method
            :method:`PlanCache.list()`. (Available starting in version 4.4)

          | See also :ref:`4.4-agg-planCachesStats-changes`.

ref: 4.4-changes-planCache-changes
content: |

   Starting in version 4.4, 
   
   - :pipeline:`$planCacheStats` stage can be run on
     :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances as well as on
     :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances. In 4.2,
     :pipeline:`$planCacheStats` stage can only run on
     :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances.

   - :pipeline:`$planCacheStats` includes new fields: the :ref:`host
     <plancachestats-host>` field and, when run against a
     :binary:`~bin.mongos`, the :ref:`shard <plancachestats-shard>`
     field.

   - :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell provides the method
     :method:`PlanCache.list()` as a wrapper for
     :pipeline:`$planCacheStats` aggregation stage.

   - MongoDB removes the following:

     - ``planCacheListPlans`` and ``planCacheListQueryShapes``
       commands, and

     - ``PlanCache.getPlansByQuery()`` and
       ``PlanCache.listQueryShapes()`` methods.

     Use :pipeline:`$planCacheStats` or :method:`PlanCache.list()` instead.

ref: 4.4-changes-rollback-directory
content: |
   Starting in Mongo 4.4, the rollback directory for a collection is named
   after the collection's UUID rather than the collection namespace; e.g.

   .. code-block:: none
      :copyable: false

      <dbpath>/rollback/20f74796-d5ea-42f5-8c95-f79b39bad190/removed.2020-02-19T04-57-11.0.bson

   For details, see :ref:`replica-set-rollback-data`.

---
ref: 4.4-changes-timestamp-format
content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, |timestampfmt| no longer supports ``ctime``.
   An example of ``ctime`` formatted date is: ``Wed Dec 31
   18:17:54.811``.
