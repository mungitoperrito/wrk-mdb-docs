  If the deployment enforces 
  :ref:`authentication/authorization <authentication>`,
  {{operation}} requires that the authenticated user have the 
  following privileges:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1

     * - 

       - Required Privileges
     
     * - Create a non-capped collection

       - :authaction:`createCollection` on the database, **or**

         :authaction:`insert` on the collection to create

     * - Create a :ref:`capped collection <manual-capped-collection>`

       - :authaction:`convertToCapped` for the collection


         :authaction:`createCollection` on the database

     * - Create a :ref:`view <3.4-reference-views>`

       - - :authaction:`createCollection` on the database 

           *or*

         - :authaction:`createCollection` on the database
           *and* :authaction:`find` on the source collection/view

           *or*

         - :authaction:`createCollection` on the database,
           :authaction:`find` on the view to create, 
           *and* :authaction:`find` on the source collection/view

         A user with :authaction:`createCollection` on the database and
         :authaction:`find` on the view to create does not have
         sufficient privileges.

  The :authrole:`readWrite` built in role provides the appropriate
  privileges for executing {{operation}}. Create a user and assign it
  the :authrole:`readWrite` role for the database in which you want to
  run {{operation}}:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.getSiblingDB("replaceThisDatabaseName").createUser(
       {
         "user" : "replaceThisUserName",
         "pwd" : "replaceThisWithASecurePassword",
         "roles" : [ "readWrite" ]
       }
     )

  For more examples of user creation, see 
  :doc:`/tutorial/create-users`. For a tutorial on adding privileges to 
  an existing database user, see :ref:`modify-existing-user-access`.

  If the deployment enforces 
  :ref:`authentication/authorization <authentication>`,
  the :method:`db.createView()` method requires the authenticated user 
  have the following privileges:

  - :authaction:`createCollection` on the database

    *or*

  - :authaction:`createCollection` on the database
    *and* :authaction:`find` on the source collection/view

    *or*

  - :authaction:`createCollection` on the database,
    :authaction:`find` on the view to create, 
    *and* :authaction:`find` on the source collection/view

  A user with :authaction:`createCollection` on the database
  and :authaction:`find` on the view to create does not have sufficient
  privileges.
