  The selection criteria for the modification. The ``query`` field
  employs the same :ref:`query selectors <query-selectors>` as used in
  the :method:`db.collection.find()` method. Although the query may
  match multiple documents, |operation|
  **will only select one document to modify**.
  
  If unspecified, defaults to an empty document.
  
  Starting in MongoDB 4.2 (and 4.0.12+, 3.6.14+, and 3.4.23+), the operation
  errors if the query argument is not a document.

  Must specify either the ``remove`` or the ``update`` field. Performs
  an update of the selected document. 
  
  - If passed a document with :ref:`update operator expressions
    <update-operators>`, |operation| performs the specified
    modification.
  
  - If passed a replacement document ``{ <field1>: <value1>, ...}``,
    the |operation| performs a replacement.

  - Starting in MongoDB 4.2, if passed an :doc:`aggregation pipeline
    </core/aggregation-pipeline>` ``[ <stage1>, <stage2>, ... ]``,
    |operation| modifies the document per the pipeline. The pipeline
    can consist of the following stages:
