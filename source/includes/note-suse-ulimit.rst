SUSE Linux Enterprise Server and potentially other SUSE distributions ship
with virtual memory address space limited to 8 GB by default. You *must*
adjust this in order to prevent virtual memory allocation failures as the
database grows.

The SLES packages for MongoDB adjust these limits in the default scripts,
but you will need to make this change manually if you are using custom
scripts and/or the tarball release rather than the SLES packages.
