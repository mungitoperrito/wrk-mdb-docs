ref: sessions-option-txnId
content: |

   A strictly increasing non-negative number that uniquely identifies
   the command in the command's session.

   If specified, the command must also include the ``lsid`` option.
---
ref: sessions-option-sessionId
content: |

   The document that specifies the unique id of the session associated
   with the command. If the ``txnNumber`` is specified, the ``lsid`` is
   required.

   .. tip::

      The :program:`mongo` shell and the drivers provide helpers to
      start the session and set the ``lsid`` for the commands.

---
ref: sessions-option-stmtIds
content: |

   Array of numbers that uniquely identifies their respective
   |operations| within the |operation| command.

   .. important::

      Do not manually set the ``stmtIds``. MongoDB sets the ``stmtIds``
      to strictly increasing non-negative number.
