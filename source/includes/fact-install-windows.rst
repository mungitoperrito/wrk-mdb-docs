1. Open Windows Explorer.

2. Change the directory path to where you downloaded the MongoDB 
   ``.msi`` file. By default, this is ``%HOMEPATH%\Downloads``.  

3. Double-click the ``.msi`` file. 

4. The Windows Installer guides you through the installation process.

   If you choose the :guilabel:`Custom` installation option, you may 
   specify an installation directory.

   MongoDB does not have any other system dependencies. You can install and run MongoDB from any folder you choose.

   .. note::

      This tutorial assumes that you installed MongoDB
      in ``C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\{+version+}\``.

   During the installation process you will be given the option to
   install :ref:`MongoDB Compass <compass-index>` after installing
   MongoDB Server. Clear the checkbox for this option. At this time, 
   there is an installation error that occurs when installing Compass 
   using the MongoDB Server installer.
