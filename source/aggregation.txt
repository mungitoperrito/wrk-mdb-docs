Aggregation operations process multiple documents and return computed
results. You can use aggregation operations to:

- Group values from multiple documents together.

- Perform operations on the grouped data to return a single result.

- Analyze data changes over time.

To perform aggregation operations, you can use:

- :ref:`Aggregation pipelines <aggregation-framework>`, which are the
  preferred method for performing aggregations.

- :ref:`Single purpose aggregation methods
  <single-purpose-agg-methods>`, which are simple but lack the
  capabilities of an aggregation pipeline.

- :ref:`Map-reduce operations <aggregation-map-reduce>`, which are
  deprecated starting in MongoDB 5.0. Instead, use an aggregation
  pipeline.

Aggregation Pipeline Example

For runnable examples containing sample input documents, see
:ref:`Complete Aggregation Pipeline Examples

Single Purpose Aggregation Methods
----------------------------------

You can use the following single purpose aggregation methods to
aggregate documents from a single collection:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 50
   
   * - Method
     - Description

   * - :method:`db.collection.estimatedDocumentCount()`
     - Returns an approximate count of the documents in a collection or
       a view.

   * - :method:`db.collection.count()`
     - Returns a count of the number of documents in a collection or a
       view.

   * - :method:`db.collection.distinct()`
     - Returns an array of documents that have distinct values for the
       specified field.

The single purpose aggregation methods are simple but lack the
capabilities of an :ref:`aggregation pipeline <aggregation-framework>`.
