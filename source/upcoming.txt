|arrow| Multi-document Transactions
   MongoDB 4.0 will add multi-document transactions for replica sets.

   .. example::

      Consider a scenario where for each order shipment, you need to
      decrease the inventory for the item shipped. If either write fails,
      you want the undo both operations.

      The following Python code shows a sample usage of transactions
      where either both write operations succeed or both operations
      fail.

      .. code-block:: python

         client = pymongo.MongoClient(...)
         db = client.test
 
         s = client.start_session()
         s.start_transaction()
 
         try:
             db.inventory.update_one({"sku": "abc123"}, {"$inc": {"qty": -100}}, session=s)
             db.shipment.insert_one({"sku": "abc123", "qty": 100}, session=s)
         except Exception:
             s.abort_transaction()
         else:
             s.commit_transaction()
         s.end_session()
