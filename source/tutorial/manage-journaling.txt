MongoDB uses *write ahead logging* to an on-disk :term:`journal` to
guarantee :doc:`write operation </crud>` durability.

The WiredTiger storage engine does not require journaling to guarantee
a consistent state after a crash. The database will be restored to the
last consistent :ref:`checkpoint <storage-wiredtiger-checkpoints>`
during recovery.  However, if MongoDB exits unexpectedly in between
checkpoints, journaling is required to recover writes that occurred
after the last checkpoint.

.. note::

  .. include:: /includes/wiredtiger-node-nojournal.rst

With journaling enabled, if :binary:`~bin.mongod` stops unexpectedly, the
program can recover everything written to the journal. MongoDB will
re-apply the write operations on restart and maintain a consistent
state. By default, the greatest extent of lost writes, i.e., those not
made to the journal, are those made in the last 100 milliseconds, plus
the time it takes to perform the actual journal writes. See
:setting:`~storage.journal.commitIntervalMs` for more information on
the default.

Procedures
----------

Disable Journaling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

  Do not disable journaling on production systems. 

  - .. include:: /includes/wiredtiger-node-nojournal.rst

To disable journaling for a standalone deployment, start
:binary:`~bin.mongod` with the :option:`--nojournal <mongod
--nojournal>` command line option.

Get Commit Acknowledgement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can get commit acknowledgement with the :ref:`write-concern` and
the :writeconcern:`j` option. For details, see
:ref:`write-concern-operation`.

Monitor Journal Status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :dbcommand:`serverStatus` command/:method:`db.serverStatus()`
method returns :serverstatus:`wiredTiger.log`, which contains
statistics on the journal.

Recover Data After Unexpected Shutdown
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On a restart after a crash, MongoDB replays all journal files in the
journal directory before the server becomes available. If MongoDB must
replay journal files, :binary:`~bin.mongod` notes these events in the log
output.

There is no reason to run ``--repair``.

Change WT Journal Compressor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the WiredTiger storage engine, MongoDB, by default,s uses the
``snappy`` compressor for the journal. To specify a different
compressions algorithm or no compression for a :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instance:

.. tip::

   If you encounter an unclean shutdown for a :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   during this procedure, you must use the old compressor settings to
   recover using the journal files. Once recovered, you can retry the
   procedure.

#. Update the
   :setting:`storage.wiredTiger.engineConfig.journalCompressor` setting
   to the new value.

   If you use command-line options instead of a configuration file, you
   will have to update the :option:`--wiredTigerJournalCompressor
   <mongod --wiredTigerJournalCompressor>` command-line option during
   the restart below.

#. Perform a clean shutdown of the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.getSiblingDB('admin').shutdownServer()

    
#. Once you have confirmed that the process is no longer running,
   restart the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance:

   - If you are using a configuration file:

     .. code-block:: sh

        mongod -f <path/to/myconfig.conf>

   - If you are using command-line options instead of a configuration
     file, update the :option:`--wiredTigerJournalCompressor <mongod
     --wiredTigerJournalCompressor>` option.

     .. code-block:: sh

        mongod --wiredTigerJournalCompressor <differentCompressor|none>  ...
