Overview
--------

The following tutorial uses ``brew`` to install MongoDB {+version+}
Community Edition on macOS systems. To install a different version of
MongoDB, please refer to that versionâ€™s documentation.

Platform Support
----------------

MongoDB only supports macOS versions 10.11 and later on Intel
x86-64. See :ref:`mongodb-supported-platforms` for more
information.

Install MongoDB Community Edition
---------------------------------

Prerequisite
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have previously tapped the official MongoDB formula repository,
you can go directly to the :ref:`install` step.

If you have not previously tapped the official MongoDB formula
repository, tap the official MongoDB formula repository to add to the
formula list.

.. code-block:: sh

   brew tap mongodb/brew 

.. _install:

Install MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: sh

   brew install mongodb-community@{+version+}

In addition to the :doc:`binaries </reference/program>`, the install
creates:

- the :doc:`configuration file </reference/configuration-options>`
  (:file:`/usr/local/etc/mongod.conf`)

- the  :setting:`log directory path <systemLog.path>` (``/usr/local/var/log/mongodb``)

- the :setting:`data directory path <storage.dbPath>` (``/usr/local/var/mongodb``)


Run MongoDB
-----------

To run MongoDB
   From a terminal, issue the following:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf

   MongoDB (specifically the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process) runs in the foreground.
   The process uses the :file:`/usr/local/etc/mongod.conf` file, created during the
   install.

To run MongoDB as a macOS service
   From a terminal, issue the following:

   .. code-block:: sh

      brew services start mongodb-community@{+version+}

   MongoDB (specifically the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process) runs as a
   service. The process uses the :file:`/usr/local/etc/mongod.conf`
   file, created during the install.

Connect and Use MongoDB
-----------------------

To begin using MongoDB, connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the
running instance.
   
.. code-block:: sh

   mongo

For information on CRUD (Create,Read,Update,Delete) operations, see:

- :doc:`/tutorial/insert-documents`
- :doc:`/tutorial/query-documents`
- :doc:`/tutorial/update-documents`
- :doc:`/tutorial/remove-documents`

Additional Considerations
-------------------------

Security
~~~~~~~~

Starting with MongoDB 3.6, MongoDB binaries, :binary:`mongod
<bin.mongod>` and :binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>`, bind to
``localhost`` by default.

When bound only to the localhost, these binaries can only accept
connections from clients that are running on the same machine. Remote
clients cannot connect to the binaries bound only to localhost. For
more information, including how to override and bind to other ip
addresses, see :ref:`3.6-bind_ip-compatibility`.
