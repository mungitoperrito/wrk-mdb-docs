.. note::

   You can also spin up MongoDB on AWS, Azure, or GCP using Atlas, our
   fully-managed database-as-a-service. Atlas enables you to configure anything
   from a free sandbox environment to a globally sharded production cluster.

You can install MongoDB by downloading the ``.tgz`` file manually or
by using ``homebrew``. Click on the appropriate tab for corresponding instructions.

            `Homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`_ installs binary packages based on published
            "formulae." This section describes how to update ``brew`` to the latest
            packages and install MongoDB Community Edition. Homebrew requires some initial
            setup and configuration, which is beyond the scope of this document.
