Client-side field level encryption uses data keys for encryption and decryption.
The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell :method:`getKeyVault()` method returns a key
vault object for creating, modifying, and deleting data keys.

Create a Data Key
-----------------

The following procedure uses the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to create a data key
for use with client-side field level encryption and decryption. For guidance on
data key management using a 4.2-compatible driver, see the documentation for
that driver.

Manage a Data Key's Alternate Name
----------------------------------

The following procedure uses the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to manage the
alternate names of a data key. For guidance on data key management using a
4.2-compatible driver, see the documentation for that driver.

Remove a Data Key
-----------------

.. warning::

    Deleting a data key renders all fields encrypted using that key as 
    permanently unreadable.

The following procedure uses the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to remove a data key
from the key vault. For guidance on data key management using a 4.2-compatible
driver, see the documentation for that driver.
