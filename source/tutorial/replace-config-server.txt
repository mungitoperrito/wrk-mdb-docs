   In version 3.4, MongoDB removes support for SCCC config servers. To
   upgrade your config servers from SCCC to CSRS, see
   :doc:`/tutorial/upgrade-config-servers-to-replica-set`.
   
   The following procedure applies to |version| config servers.

   For replacing config servers for other MongoDB versions, refer to
   the appropriate version of the MongoDB Manual. For example, if you
   are running a v3.2 sharded cluster with SCCC, see the following
   tutorials in the v3.2 manual:
   :v3.2:`/tutorial/migrate-config-servers-with-same-hostname` and
   :v3.2:`/tutorial/migrate-config-servers-with-different-hostnames`

Overview
--------

If the config server replica set becomes read only, i.e. does not
have a primary, the sharded cluster cannot support operations that change
the cluster metadata, such as chunk splits and migrations. Although no
chunks can be split or migrated, applications will be able to write data
to the sharded cluster.

If one of the config servers is unavailable or inoperable, repair or
replace it as soon as possible. The following procedure replaces a member
of a :ref:`config server replica set <sharding-config-server>` with a new
member.

The tutorial is specific to MongoDB |version|. For earlier versions of
MongoDB, refer to the corresponding version of the MongoDB Manual.
