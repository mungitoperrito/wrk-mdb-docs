System Requirements
-------------------

MongoDB Community Edition requires Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 or 
later or Microsoft Windows 7 or later on an x86 64-bit architecture. 
The Windows installer (``.msi``) file includes all other
software dependencies and automatically upgrades any previous version 
of MongoDB that was installed using an ``.msi`` file.

To find which version, service pack, and build of Windows is  
running on your host, as well as the processor type of that host, 
enter the following command in either the :guilabel:`Command Prompt` or
:guilabel:`Powershell`:

.. code-block:: powershell

   PS C:\> systeminfo | findstr /B /C:"OS Name" /C:"OS Version" /C:"System Type"

.. code-block:: powershell
   :copyable: false

   OS Name:                   Microsoft Windows 10 Pro
   OS Version:                10.0.17134 N/A Build 17134
   System Type:               x64-based PC

Make certain that you show set Windows Explorer to show file name 
extensions for all file types. This can prevent issues where the file 
extension that is shown is not the file extension that Windows 
understands.

.. example::

   If Windows Explorer has known file extensions hidden, what may 
   appear to be ``mongod.cfg`` is actually ``mongod.cfg.txt``.

.. important:: 

   Before installing MongoDB, update your Windows host with the latest 
   system updates. At minimum, ensure the following Windows updates 
   are installed on the host:

   - Windows 2012 Server and Windows 10 need 
     `KB2999226 <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2999226/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows>`__ 
     to provide Universal C Runtime support for Windows.

   - Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 need 
     `KB2731284 <http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2731284>`__ to resolve
     an issue with memory mapped files on Windows.

Run MongoDB Community Edition
-----------------------------

.. warning::

   Do not make :binary:`~bin.mongod.exe` visible on public networks without
   running in "Secure Mode" with the :setting:`auth` setting. MongoDB is
   designed to be run in trusted environments, and the database does not
   enable "Secure Mode" by default.

Manually Create a Windows Service for MongoDB Community Edition
---------------------------------------------------------------

You can set up the MongoDB server as a :guilabel:`Windows Service` that
starts automatically at boot time.

The following procedure assumes you have installed MongoDB Community 
using the ``.msi`` installer with the path 
``C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\{+version+}\``.

If you have installed in an alternative directory, you must
adjust the paths as appropriate.
