Overview
--------

Use this tutorial to install MongoDB Community Edition on Windows systems.

.. admonition:: Platform Support

   Starting in version 2.2, MongoDB does not support Windows XP. Please
   use a more recent version of Windows to use more recent releases of
   MongoDB.

.. important:: If you are running any edition of Windows Server 2008
   R2 or Windows 7, please install `a hotfix to resolve an issue with
   memory mapped files on Windows <http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2731284>`_.

Requirements
------------

MongoDB Community Edition requires Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, or
later. The ``.msi`` installer includes all other software dependencies
and will automatically upgrade any older version of MongoDB installed
using an ``.msi`` file.

Run MongoDB Community Edition
-----------------------------

.. warning::

   Do not make :program:`mongod.exe` visible on public networks without
   running in "Secure Mode" with the :setting:`auth` setting. MongoDB is
   designed to be run in trusted environments, and the database does not
   enable "Secure Mode" by default.

Manually Create a Windows Service for MongoDB Community Edition
---------------------------------------------------------------

You can set up the MongoDB server as a :guilabel:`Windows Service` that
starts automatically at boot time.

The following procedure assumes you have installed MongoDB Community using the
``.msi`` installer with the path ``C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\``.

If you have installed in an alternative directory, you will need to
adjust the paths as appropriate.
