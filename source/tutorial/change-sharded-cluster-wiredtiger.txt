====================================
Change Sharded Cluster to WiredTiger
====================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. versionadded:: 3.0
   The WiredTiger storage engine is available. Also, sharded clusters
   may have individual shards with different storage engine
   configurations.

.. versionchanged:: 3.2
   WiredTiger is the new default storage engine for MongoDB.

This tutorial gives an overview of changing the storage engines of a
component of a :term:`sharded cluster` to :ref:`WiredTiger
<storage-wiredtiger>`.

Considerations
--------------

This procedure may involve downtime, especially if one or more of your
shards is a :term:`standalone`. If you change the host or port of any
:term:`shard`, you must update the shard configuration as well.

Change Shards to WiredTiger
---------------------------

.. note::

   A sharded cluster **can** have mixed storage engines for its
   individual :term:`shards <shard>`.

To change the storage engine for the :term:`shards <shard>` to
WiredTiger, refer to the appropriate procedure for each shard:

- If the shard is a :term:`standalone`, see
  :doc:`/tutorial/change-standalone-wiredtiger`.

- If the shard is a :term:`replica set`, see
  :doc:`/tutorial/change-replica-set-wiredtiger`.

Change Config Servers to WiredTiger
-----------------------------------

Starting in MongoDB 3.4, MongoDB removes support for SCCC config
servers. Before you can upgrade your sharded clusters to 3.4, you must
convert your config servers from SCCC to CSRS. The upgrade to CSRS
procedure includes steps to change the config servers to use WiredTiger.

For details, see :v3.4:`/tutorial/upgrade-config-servers-to-replica-set`.
