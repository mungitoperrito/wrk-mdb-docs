For the best installation experience, MongoDB provides packages for popular
Linux distributions. These packages, which support
specific platforms and provide improved performance and TLS/SSL
support, are the preferred way to run MongoDB. The following guides
detail the installation process for these systems:

For systems without supported packages, refer to the Manual
Installation tutorial.

Manual Installation
-------------------

For Linux systems without supported packages, MongoDB provides a
generic Linux release. These versions of MongoDB don't include TLS/SSL,
and may not perform as well as the targeted packages, but are
compatible on most contemporary Linux systems. See the
following guides for installation:
