.. method:: rs.remove(hostname)

   Removes the member described by the ``hostname`` parameter from the
   current :term:`replica set`. This function will disconnect the
   shell briefly and forces a reconnection as the :term:`replica set`
   renegotiates which member will be :term:`primary`. As a
   result, the shell will display an error even if this command
   succeeds.

   The :method:`rs.remove()` method has the following parameter:

   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/method-rs.remove-param.rst

   .. note::

      Before running the :method:`rs.remove()` operation, it is good
      practice to *shut down* the replica set member that you are
      removing.
