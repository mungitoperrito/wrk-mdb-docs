The following methods are for the MongoDB :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
*only*. For instructions on implementing client-side field level
encryption using a MongoDB 4.2-compatible driver, defer to the
driver documentation. See :ref:`field-level-encryption-drivers` for
a complete list of 4.2-compatible drivers with support for
client-side field level encryption.
