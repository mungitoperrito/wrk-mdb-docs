.. method:: rs.status()

   Returns the replica set status from the point of view of the member
   where the method is run.

   This output reflects the current status of the replica set, using
   data derived from the heartbeat packets sent by the other members
   of the replica set.

   This method provides a wrapper around the
   :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus` command.

   Starting in MongoDB 3.4, the :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus` command
   can accept the optional ``initialSync: 1`` to report on initial sync
   status and progress if the command is run on the secondary. To
   report on initial sync for the secondary, you must run the command
   instead of the helper.

<rs-status-output>`.
