``mongoreplay`` is a traffic capture and replay tool for MongoDB
that you can use to inspect and record commands sent to a MongoDB
instance, and then replay those commands back onto another host at a
later time.

``mongoreplay`` replaced ``mongosniff`` in MongoDB 3.4.

.. admonition:: ``mongoreplay`` removed from MongoDB Packaging
   :class: note

   packaging. ``mongoreplay`` and its related documentation are migrated
   to the `mongodb-labs <https://github.com/mongodb-labs/mongoreplay>`__
   github project. Projects in ``mongodb-labs`` are experimental and not
   officially supported by MongoDB.
