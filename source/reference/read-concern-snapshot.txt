Read concern ``"snapshot"`` is only available for :doc:`multi-document
transactions </core/transactions>`.

- If the transaction is not part of a :ref:`causally consistent session
  <sessions>`, upon transaction commit, the transaction operations are
  guaranteed to have read from a snapshot of majority committed data.

- If the transaction is part of a :ref:`causally consistent session
  <sessions>`, upon transaction commit, the transaction operations are
  guaranteed to have read from a snapshot of majority committed data
  that provides causal consistency with the operation immediately
  preceding the transaction start.

Read Concern and Transactions
-----------------------------

Multi-document transactions support read concern
:readconcern:`"snapshot"` as well as :readconcern:`"local"`, and
:readconcern:`"majority"`.

.. note::

   You set the read concern at the transaction level, not at the
   individual operation level.

Write Operations and Read Concern ``"snapshot"``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a multi-document transaction, both the read operations and the write
operations support read concern level. When part of a transaction, the
following write operations support read concern:

- :dbcommand:`delete`

- :dbcommand:`findAndModify`

- :dbcommand:`insert`

- :dbcommand:`update`

For a list of all operations that accept read concerns, see
:ref:`read-concern-operations`.

Causally Consistent Sessions
----------------------------

:readconcern:`snapshot` is available for transactions that are part of
a causally consistent session.
