.. dbcommand:: balancerStart

   .. versionadded:: 3.4

   Starts the balancer thread. The command does not wait for a
   balancing round to start. You can only issue the
   :dbcommand:`balancerStart` against the ``admin`` database on a
   :program:`mongos` instance.

   The command takes the following form:

   .. versionchanged:: 3.6

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand(
         {
            balancerStart: 1,
            maxTimeMS: <number>,
            txnNumber: <long>,   // Set by the 3.6 drivers and mongo shell
            lsid: { id: <UUID> } // Set by the 3.6 drivers and mongo shell
         }
      )

   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/dbcommand-balancerStart-field.rst

Example
-------

To start the balancer thread, connect to a :program:`mongos` instance
and issue the following command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { balancerStart: 1 } )
