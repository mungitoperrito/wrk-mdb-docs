   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( { "killCursors": <collection>, "cursors": [ <cursor id1>, ... ] } )

   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/dbcommand-killCursors-field.rst

Access Control
--------------

On systems running with :setting:`~security.authorization`:

- To kill cursors from :dbcommand:`find` operations on a collection,
  the user must have access that includes the privilege to
  :authaction:`killCursors` and :authaction:`find` on the collection.

- To kill cursors from :dbcommand:`listIndexes` operations on a
  collection, the user must have access that includes the privilege to
  :authaction:`killCursors` and :authaction:`listIndexes` on the
  collection.

- To kill cursors from :dbcommand:`listCollections` operations on a
  database, the user must have access that includes the privilege to
  :authaction:`killCursors` and :authaction:`listCollections` on the
  database.

Example
-------

Consider the following :dbcommand:`find` operation on the
``test.restaurants`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use test
   db.runCommand(
      { find: "restaurants",
        filter: { stars: 5 },
        projection: { name: 1, rating: 1, address: 1 },
        sort: { name: 1 },
        batchSize: 5
      }
   )

which returns the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "waitedMS" : NumberLong(0),
      "cursor" : {
         "firstBatch" : [
            {
               "_id" : ObjectId("57506d63f578028074723dfd"),
               "name" : "Cakes and more"
            },
            {
               "_id" : ObjectId("57506d63f578028074723e0b"),
               "name" : "Pies and things"
            },
            {
               "_id" : ObjectId("57506d63f578028074723e1d"),
               "name" : "Ice Cream Parlour"
            },
            {
               "_id" : ObjectId("57506d63f578028074723e65"),
               "name" : "Cream Puffs"
            },
            {
               "_id" : ObjectId("57506d63f578028074723e66"),
               "name" : "Cakes and Rolls"
            }
         ],
         "id" : NumberLong("18314637080"),
         "ns" : "test.restaurants"
      },
      "ok" : 1
   }

To kill this cursor, use the :dbcommand:`killCursors` command.

.. code-block:: javascript

   use test

   db.runCommand( { killCursors: "restaurants", cursors: [ NumberLong("18314637080") ] } )

:dbcommand:`killCursors` returns the following operation details:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "cursorsKilled" : [
         NumberLong("18314637080")
      ],
      "cursorsNotFound" : [ ],
      "cursorsAlive" : [ ],
      "cursorsUnknown" : [ ],
      "ok" : 1
   }
