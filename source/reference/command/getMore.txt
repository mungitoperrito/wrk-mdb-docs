.. dbcommand:: getMore

   .. versionadded:: 3.2

   Use in conjunction with commands that return a cursor, e.g.
   :dbcommand:`find` and :dbcommand:`aggregate`, to return subsequent
   batches of documents currently pointed to by the cursor.

   The :dbcommand:`getMore` command has the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
         "getMore": <long>,
         "collection": <string>,
         "batchSize": <int>,
         "maxTimeMS": <int>
      }

   The command accepts the following fields:

   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/dbcommand-getMore-field.rst

   If :doc:`authentication </core/authentication>` is turned on, you can only issue a :dbcommand:`getMore`
   against cursors you created.
