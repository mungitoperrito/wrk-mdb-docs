.. dbcommand:: cloneCollectionAsCapped

   The :dbcommand:`cloneCollectionAsCapped` command creates a new
   :term:`capped collection` from an existing, non-capped collection
   within the same database. The operation does not affect the
   original non-capped collection. 

   The command has the following syntax:

   .. versionchanged:: 3.6

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
         cloneCollectionAsCapped: <existing collection>,
         toCollection: <capped collection>,
         size: <capped size>,
         txnNumber: <long>,   // Set by the 3.6 drivers and mongo shell
         lsid: { id: <UUID> } // Set by the 3.6 drivers and mongo shell
      }

   The command has the following fields:
   
   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Field
        - Type
        - Description

      * - ``cloneCollectionAsCapped``
        - String
        - Name of the existing collection to copy.

      * - ``toCollection``
        - String
        - Name of the new capped collection to create.

          The name of the new capped collection must be
          distinct and cannot be the same as that of the original existing
          collection.

      * - ``size``
        - number
        - Maximum size of the capped collection.

      * - ``txnNumber``

        - 64-bit integer/long

        - Optional.

      * - ``lsid``
        - Document
        - Optional.

   .. |command| replace:: cloneCollectionAsCapped

   .. include:: /includes/fact-dbcommand.rst

   To replace the original non-capped collection with a capped
   collection, use the :dbcommand:`convertToCapped` command instead.


Behavior
--------

If the ``capped size`` is less than the size of the source collection,
then not all documents in the source collection will exist in the destination
capped collection.
