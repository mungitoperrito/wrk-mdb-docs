.. dbcommand:: clone

   The :dbcommand:`clone` command clones a database from a
   remote MongoDB instance to the current host. :dbcommand:`clone` copies the
   database on the remote instance with the same name as the current
   database. The command takes the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

        { clone: "db1.example.net:27017" }

   Replace ``db1.example.net:27017`` above with the resolvable hostname for the
   MongoDB instance you wish to copy from. Note the following
   behaviors:

   - :dbcommand:`clone` can copy from a non-:term:`primary` member of a :term:`replica set`.

   - :dbcommand:`clone` does not snapshot the database. If any clients
     update the database you're copying at any point during the clone
     operation, the resulting database may be inconsistent.

   - You must run :dbcommand:`clone` on the **destination server**.

   - The destination database will be locked periodically during the
     :dbcommand:`clone` operation. In other words, :dbcommand:`clone` will occasionally yield to
     allow other operations on the database to complete.

   See :dbcommand:`copydb` for similar functionality with greater flexibility.
