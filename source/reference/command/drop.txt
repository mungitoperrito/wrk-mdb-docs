.. dbcommand:: drop

   The :dbcommand:`drop` command removes an entire collection from a
   database. The command has following syntax:

   .. versionchanged:: 3.6

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { drop: <collection_name>, txnNumber: <long>, lsid: { id: <UUID> } }

   The command can take the following options:

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/retryable-writes-table-options.rst

   This command also removes any indexes associated with the dropped
   collection.

   .. warning::

      This command obtains a write lock on the affected database and
      will block other operations until it has completed.

   The :program:`mongo` shell provides the equivalent helper method
   :method:`db.collection.drop()`.
