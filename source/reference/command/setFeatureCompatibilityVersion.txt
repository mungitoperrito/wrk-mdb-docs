.. dbcommand:: setFeatureCompatibilityVersion

   .. versionadded:: 3.4

   .. versionchanged:: 3.6

   Enables or disables the features that persist data incompatible with
   earlier versions of MongoDB. You can only issue the
   :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` against the ``admin``
   database.

   The command takes the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: <version> } )

   The values for the ``version`` are:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 15 85

      * - Version
        - Description

      * - ``"3.6"``

        - *Available on MongoDB 3.6 Deployments*

          Enables the :ref:`3.6 features that persist data incompatible
          with MongoDB 3.4 <3.6-compatibility-enabled>`.

            .. include:: /includes/3.6-featureCompatibility-caveat.rst


      * - ``"3.4"``

        - *Available on MongoDB 3.4 and MongoDB 3.6 Deployments*

          - If set on MongoDB 3.4 deployments, 
              Enables the :ref:`3.4 features that persist data
              incompatible with MongoDB 3.2
              <3.4-compatibility-enabled>`.

            .. include:: /includes/3.4-featureCompatibility-caveat.rst

          - If set on MongoDB 3.6 deployments,
              Disables the :ref:`3.6 features that persist data
              incompatible with MongoDB 3.4
              <3.6-compatibility-enabled>`.

      * - ``"3.2"``

        - *Available on MongoDB 3.4 Deployments*

          Disables the :ref:`3.4 features that persist data

Idempotency
~~~~~~~~~~~

This command must perform writes to an internal system collection. If
for any reason the command does not complete successfully, you can
safely retry the command as the operation is idempotent.

Examples
--------

View FeatureCompatibilityVersion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` for a :program:`mongod`
instance, run the following command on a :program:`mongod` instance:

.. note::
   The operation is undefined on the :program:`mongos` instances.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

Set Feature Compatibility Version on MongoDB 3.6 Deployments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enable 3.6 Backwards Incompatible Features
``````````````````````````````````````````

To enable the :ref:`3.6 features that persist data incompatible with
MongoDB 3.4 <3.6-compatibility-enabled>`, set the feature compatibility
to ``"3.6"`` on the MongoDB 3.6 deployment:

.. note::

   Run the :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` command against
   the ``admin`` database.

   .. include:: /includes/list-run-command-targets.rst

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "3.6" } )

Disable 3.6 Backwards Incompatible Features
````````````````````````````````````````````

To disable the :ref:`3.6 features that persist data incompatible with
MongoDB 3.4 <3.6-compatibility-enabled>`, set the feature compatibility
to ``"3.4"`` on the MongoDB 3.6 deployment:

.. note::

   Run the :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` command against
   the ``admin`` database.

   .. include:: /includes/list-run-command-targets.rst
   
   - ``"3.4"`` featureCompatibilityVersion is supported on MongoDB
     3.6 and MongoDB 3.4 Deployments Only.


.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "3.4" } )

Set Feature Compatibility Version on MongoDB 3.4 Deployments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enable 3.4 Backwards Incompatible Features
``````````````````````````````````````````

.. warning::

   .. include:: /includes/3.4-featureCompatibility-caveat.rst

To enable the 3.4 features that are :ref:`backward incompatible
<3.4-compatibility-enabled>`, set the feature compatibility
to ``"3.4"`` on the MongoDB 3.4 deployment:

.. note::

   Run the :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` command against
   the ``admin`` database.

   .. include:: /includes/list-run-command-targets.rst

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "3.4" } )

Disable 3.4 Backwards Incompatible Features
````````````````````````````````````````````

To disable the :ref:`3.4 backwards-incompatible features
<3.4-compatibility-enabled>`, set the feature compatibility
to ``"3.2"`` on the MongoDB 3.4 deployment:

.. note::

   Run the ``setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`` command against the
   ``admin`` database.

   .. include:: /includes/list-run-command-targets.rst

   - ``"3.2"`` featureCompatibilityVersion is supported on MongoDB
     3.4 and MongoDB 3.2 Deployments Only.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "3.2" } )

Setting the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` to ``"3.2"`` disables the
use of these features but does not remove existing usage of these
features.

If performed as part of a downgrade to 3.2 procedure, you must also
manually remove the existing usage before downgrading the binaries. For
details, see :ref:`3.4-downgrade-features-prereq`.
