.. dbcommand:: setFeatureCompatibilityVersion

   .. versionadded:: 3.4

   .. versionchanged:: 3.6

   Enables or disables the features that are backwards-incompatible
   with earlier versions. You can only issue the
   :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` against the ``admin``
   database.
   
   The command takes the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: <version> } )

   The values for the ``version`` are:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 15 85

      * - Version
        - Description

      * - ``"3.6"``

        - Enables the 3.6 features that are :ref:`backward incompatible
          <3.6-compatibility-enabled>`.

          **Available on MongoDB 3.6 Deployments Only**

      * - ``"3.4"``

        - Enables the 3.4 features that are :ref:`backward incompatible
          <3.4-compatibility-enabled>` with earlier
          versions and disables the 3.6 or later features that are
          backward incompatible with 3.4

          **Available on MongoDB 3.6 and MongoDB 3.4 Deployments Only**

          .. include:: /includes/3.4-featureCompatibility-caveat.rst

      * - ``"3.2"``

        - Disables the 3.4 or later features that are
          backwards-incompatible with MongoDB 3.2.

          **Available on MongoDB 3.4 and MongoDB 3.2 Deployments Only**

Behavior

Default Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/list-table-featureCompatibilityVersion-defaults.rst

Idempotency
~~~~~~~~~~~

This command must perform writes to an internal system collection. If
for any reason the command does not complete successfully, you can
safely retry the command as the operation is idempotent.

Examples
--------

View FeatureCompatibilityVersion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` for a :program:`mongod`
instance, run the following command on a :program:`mongod` instance:

.. note::
   The operation is undefined on the :program:`mongos` instances.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

Enable 3.6 Backwards Incompatible Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable the 3.6 features that are :ref:`backward incompatible
<3.6-compatibility-enabled>`, run the
``setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`` command against the ``admin``
database:

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/list-run-command-targets.rst

   - ``"3.6"`` featureCompatibilityVersion is supported on MongoDB
     3.6 Deployments Only.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "3.6" } )

Enable 3.4 Backwards Incompatible Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable the 3.4 features that are :ref:`backward incompatible
<3.4-compatibility-enabled>`, run the
``setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`` command against the ``admin``
database:

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/list-run-command-targets.rst
   
   - ``"3.4"`` featureCompatibilityVersion is supported on MongoDB
     3.6 and MongoDB 3.4 Deployments Only.


.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "3.4" } )

.. warning::

   .. include:: /includes/3.4-featureCompatibility-caveat.rst

Disable 3.4 Backwards Incompatible Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To disable the :ref:`3.4 backwards-incompatible features
<3.4-compatibility-enabled>`, run the
``setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`` command against the ``admin``
database:

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/list-run-command-targets.rst

   - ``"3.2"`` featureCompatibilityVersion is supported on MongoDB
     3.4 and MongoDB 3.2 Deployments Only.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "3.2" } )

Setting the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` to ``"3.2`` disables the
use of these features and does not remove existing usage of these
features.

If performed as part of a downgrade to 3.2 procedure, you must also
manually remove the existing usage before downgrading the binaries. For
details, see :ref:`3.4-downgrade-features-prereq`.
