.. dbcommand:: flushRouterConfig

   :dbcommand:`flushRouterConfig` clears the cached routing table in a
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance. Subsequent :binary:`~bin.mongos`
   commands update the routing table as routes are needed.

   When this command is called, it forces an update when the
   configuration database holds data that is more recent than the data
   cached in the :binary:`~bin.mongos` process.

   .. warning::

      Do not modify the config data, except as explicitly
      documented. A config database cannot typically tolerate manual
      manipulation.

   :dbcommand:`flushRouterConfig` is an administrative command that is
   only available for :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances.

   Call this command using the following form:
   
   .. example::

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.adminCommand("flushRouterConfig")

   .. versionadded:: 1.8.2
