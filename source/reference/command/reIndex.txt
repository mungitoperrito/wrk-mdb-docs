.. dbcommand:: reIndex

   The :dbcommand:`reIndex` command drops all indexes on a
   collection and recreates them. This operation may be expensive for
   collections that have a large amount of data and/or a large number
   of indexes. Use the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { reIndex: "collection" }

   Normally, MongoDB compacts indexes during routine updates. For most
   users, the :dbcommand:`reIndex` command is unnecessary. However, it
   may be worth running if the collection size has changed significantly
   or if the indexes are consuming a disproportionate amount of disk space.

   Call :dbcommand:`reIndex` using the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.reIndex();

   behavior of indexing operations in MongoDB.
