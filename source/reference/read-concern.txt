Read Concern
============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 1
   :class: singlecol

.. versionchanged:: 3.6

   Add support for :ref:`afterClusterTime` for :readconcern:`"local"`
   and :readconcern:`"majority"` read concern level.

.. versionchanged:: 3.4

     Adds support for :readconcern:`"linearizable"` read concern level.

.. versionadded:: 3.2

The ``readConcern`` query option for replica sets and replica set
shards determines which data to return from a query.

.. code-block:: javascript

   readConcern: { level: <"majority"|"local"|"linearizable"> }
   readConcern: { level: <"majority"|"local"> , afterClusterTime: <Timestamp> }

.. _read-concern-levels:

Read Concern Levels
-------------------

The following read concern levels are available:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 90

   * - ``level``
     - Description

   * - .. readconcern:: "local"

     - Default. The query returns the instance's most recent data.
       Provides no guarantee that the data has been written to a
       majority of the replica set members (i.e. may be rolled back).

   * - .. readconcern:: "majority"

     - The query returns the instance's most recent data acknowledged
       as having been written to a majority of members in the replica
       set.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-enable-majority-readConcern.rst

   * - .. readconcern:: "linearizable"

     - The query returns data that reflects all successful writes
       issued with a write concern of :writeconcern:`"majority"` *and*
       acknowledged prior to the start of the read operation. For
       replica sets that run with
       :rsconf:`writeConcernMajorityJournalDefault` set to true,
       linearizable read concern returns data that will never be rolled
       back. 

       .. include:: /includes/extracts/no-journaling-rollback.rst

       You can specify linearizable read concern for read operations on
       the :replstate:`primary <PRIMARY>` only.

       Linearizable read concern guarantees only apply if read
       operations specify a query filter that uniquely identifies a
       single document.

       .. tip::

          Always use ``maxTimeMS`` with linearizable read concern in
          case a majority of data bearing members are unavailable.
          ``maxTimeMS`` ensures that the operation does not block
          indefinitely and instead ensures that the operation returns
          an error if the read concern cannot be fulfilled.

       Linearizable read concern is available for both MMAPv1 and
       WiredTiger. See :ref:`read-concern-storage-engine-drivers`.

       .. versionadded:: 3.4

.. include:: /includes/fact-readConcern-most-recent-data-in-node.rst

.. _afterClusterTime:

``afterClusterTime``
--------------------

.. versionadded:: 3.6

Starting in version 3.6, MongoDB introduces the ``afterClusterTime``
option that can be set by the drivers. Read operations with a specified
``afterClusterTime`` return data that meets the level requirement and
the specified after cluster time requirement.

:ref:`Causally consistent sessions<causal-consistency>` use
``afterClusterTime`` to provide :ref:`causal consistency`.

``afterClusterTime`` is available for :readconcern:`"local"` (default)
and :readconcern:`"majority"` read concern levels:

.. code-block:: javascript

   readConcern: { level: <"majority"|"local"> , afterClusterTime: <Timestamp> }

.. important::

   Do not manually set the ``afterClusterTime``. MongoDB drivers set
   this value automatically for operations associated with
   :ref:`causally consistent sessions <causal-consistency>`.

.. _read-concern-storage-engine-drivers:

Storage Engine and Drivers Support
----------------------------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 30 20

   * - Read Concern
     - WiredTiger
     - MMAPv1
     
   * - :readconcern:`"local"`
     - |checkmark|
     - |checkmark|

   * - :readconcern:`"majority"`
     - |checkmark|
     -

   * - :readconcern:`"linearizable"`
     - |checkmark|
     - |checkmark|

.. tip::

   The :dbcommand:`serverStatus` command returns the
   :serverstatus:`storageEngine.supportsCommittedReads` field which
   indicates whether the storage engine supports ``"majority"`` read
   concern.

MongoDB drivers updated for 3.2 and later versions support specifying
a read concern option.

.. include:: /includes/unicode-checkmark.rst

``readConcern`` Option
----------------------

.. versionchanged:: 3.6

Use the ``readConcern`` option to specify the read concern level [#after-cluster-time]_ :

.. code-block:: javascript

   readConcern: { level: <"majority"|"local"|"linearizable"> }

The ``readConcern`` option is available for the following operations:

- :dbcommand:`find` command

- :dbcommand:`aggregate` command and the
  :method:`db.collection.aggregate()` method

- :dbcommand:`distinct` command

- :dbcommand:`count` command

- :dbcommand:`parallelCollectionScan` command

- :dbcommand:`geoNear` command

- :dbcommand:`geoSearch` command

To specify the read concern level for the :program:`mongo` shell method
:method:`db.collection.find()`, use the :method:`cursor.readConcern()`
method.

.. [#after-cluster-time]

   For :ref:`causally consistent sessions <causal-consistency>`,
   MongoDB drivers automatically specifies the :ref:`afterClusterTime`
   value in the read concern.

Considerations
--------------

Read Your Own Writes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 3.6

.. include:: /includes/fact-read-own-writes.rst

Real Time Order
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Combined with :writeconcern:`"majority"` write concern,
:readconcern:`"linearizable"` read concern enables multiple threads to
perform reads and writes on a single document as if a single thread
performed these operations in real time; that is, the corresponding
schedule for these reads and writes is considered linearizable.

Performance Comparisons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unlike :readconcern:`"majority"`, :readconcern:`"linearizable"` read
concern confirms with secondary members that the read operation is
reading from a primary that is capable of confirming writes with
:writeconcern:`{ w: "majority" } <"majority">` write concern.
[#edge-cases-2-primaries]_ As such, reads with linearizable read
concern may be significantly slower than reads with
:readconcern:`"majority"` or :readconcern:`"local"` read concerns.

Always use ``maxTimeMS`` with linearizable read concern in case a
majority of data bearing members are unavailable. ``maxTimeMS`` ensures
that the operation does not block indefinitely and instead ensures that
the operation returns an error if the read concern cannot be fulfilled.

For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.restaurants.find( { _id: 5 } ).readConcern("linearizable").maxTimeMS(10000)

   db.runCommand( {
        find: "restaurants",
        filter: { _id: 5 },
        readConcern: { level: "linearizable" },
        maxTimeMS: 10000
   } )
