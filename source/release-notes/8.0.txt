This page describes changes and new features introduced in MongoDB 8.0.

MongoDB 8.0 is a |lts| Release, which means that it is supported for
both MongoDB Atlas and on-premises deployments. MongoDB 8.0 includes
changes introduced in MongoDB Rapid Releases 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3. To see
changes introduced in these rapid releases, see
:ref:`8.0-rapid-release-changes`. 

To learn more about the differences between |lts| and Rapid releases,
see :ref:`release-version-numbers`. 

General Changes
---------------

Compaction Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Background Compaction 
`````````````````````

Starting in MongoDB 8.0, you can use the new :dbcommand:`autoCompact` command 
to perform background compaction. If enabled, the server attempts to keep free 
space within each collection and index below the specified the 
``freeSpaceTargetMB`` value.

dryRun Option 
`````````````

.. include:: /includes/fact-compact-dryrun.rst 

Query Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 8.0, use the new query settings instead of
:ref:`index filters <index-filters>`. Index filters are deprecated
starting in MongoDB 8.0. Query settings have more functionality
than index filters. 

- To add query settings, use :dbcommand:`setQuerySettings`.
- To delete query settings, use :dbcommand:`removeQuerySettings`.
- To retrieve query settings, use a :pipeline:`$querySettings` stage in
  an aggregation pipeline.
- To block a :ref:`query shape <queryStats-queryShape>`, see
  :ref:`operation rejection filters <operation-rejection-filters>`.

New Bulk Write Command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/bulkWrite-introduction.rst

Default Timeout for Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 8.0, you can use the :parameter:`defaultMaxTimeMS`
cluster parameter to specify a default time limit for individual read
operations to complete.
