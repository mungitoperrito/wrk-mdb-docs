Downgrade Path

.. |downgrading| replace:: downgrading

Create Backup
-------------

*Optional but Recommended.*  Create a backup of your database.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before downgrading the binaries, you must downgrade the feature
compatibility version and remove any |newversion| features
:ref:`incompatible <3.6-compatibility-enabled>` with |oldversion|
versions as outlined below. These steps are necessary only if
``featureCompatibilityVersion`` has ever been set to ``"3.6"``.

.. |target| replace:: :program:`mongod` instance

.. _3.6-downgrade-feature-compatibility-standalone:

1. Downgrade Feature Compatibility Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Connect a :program:`mongo` shell to the |target|.

#. .. include:: /includes/3.6-downgrade-fcv.rst

2. Remove Backwards Incompatible Persisted Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remove all persisted features that are :ref:`incompatible
<3.6-compatibility-enabled>` with 3.4. For example, if you have defined
any document validators using the :query:`$jsonSchema` or
:query:`$expr` or any views using new 3.6 query features, you must
remove these validators or views.
