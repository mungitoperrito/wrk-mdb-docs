Downgrade Path
--------------

.. include:: /includes/downgrade-path.rst

.. |downgrading| replace:: downgrading

Create Backup
-------------

*Optional but Recommended.*  Create a backup of your database.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before downgrading the binaries, you must downgrade the
``featureCompatibilityVersion`` (fCV) and remove any |newversion|
features :ref:`incompatible <4.2-compatibility-enabled>` with
|oldversion| or earlier versions as outlined below. These steps are
necessary only if fCV has ever been set to ``"4.2"``.

.. |target| replace:: :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance

.. _4.2-downgrade-feature-compatibility-sharded-cluster:

1. Downgrade Feature Compatibility Version (fCV)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the |target|.

#. .. include:: /includes/4.2-downgrade-fcv.rst

To ensure that all members of the sharded cluster reflect the updated
``featureCompatibilityVersion``, connect to each shard replica set
member and each config server replica set member and check the
``featureCompatibilityVersion``:

.. tip::

   For a sharded cluster that has access control enabled, to run the
   following command against a shard replica set member, you must
   connect to the member as a :ref:`shard local user
   <shard-local-users>`.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

All members should return a result that includes:

.. code-block:: javascript

   "featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "4.0" }

If any member returns a ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` of ``"4.2"``,
wait for the member to reflect version ``"4.0"`` before proceeding.

For more information on the returned ``featureCompatibilityVersion``
value, see :ref:`view-fcv`.

2. Remove Backwards Incompatible Persisted Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remove all persisted 4.2 features that are :ref:`incompatible with 4.0
<4.2-compatibility-enabled>`.

Procedure
---------

Downgrade a Sharded Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

   Before proceeding with the downgrade procedure, ensure that all
   members, including delayed replica set members in the sharded
   cluster, reflect the prerequisite changes.  That is, check the
   ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` and the removal of incompatible
   features for each node before downgrading.
