Downgrade Path
--------------

.. include:: /includes/3.6-downgrade-path.rst

Create Backup
-------------

*Optional but Recommended.*  Create a backup of your database.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before downgrading the binaries, you must downgrade the feature
compatibility version and remove any |newversion| features
:ref:`incompatible <3.6-compatibility-enabled>` with |oldversion| or earlier
versions as generally outlined below. These steps are necessary only if
``featureCompatibilityVersion`` has ever been set to ``"3.6"``.

.. |target| replace:: primary

.. _3.6-downgrade-feature-compatibility-rs:

1. Downgrade Feature Compatibility Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tip::

   Ensure that no initial sync is in progress. Running
   :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` command while an initial
   sync is in progress will cause the initial sync to restart.

#. Connect a :program:`mongo` shell to the |target|.

#. .. include:: /includes/3.6-downgrade-fcv.rst

2. Remove ``jsonSchema`` from Document Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
If you have defined any document validator using the
:query:`$jsonSchema`, use :dbcommand:`collMod` command to replace the
document validator.


Procedure
---------

.. warning::

   Before proceding with the downgrade procedure, ensure that all
   replica set members, including delayed replica set members, reflect
   the prerequisite changes.
