=====================================================
Compatibility Changes in for Development Series 3.3.x
=====================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. include:: /includes/3.3-dev-series.rst

See also :doc:`/release-notes/3.3-dev-series`.

Sharded Cluster Changes
-----------------------

.. COMMENT to docs:  this section can be singlesourced since we refer to it in both rel notes and compatibility page (figured these changes are significant enought to place in both places)

Removal for Configuration Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 3.3.x removes the following configuration options from
the :program:`mongos`:

- :setting:`sharding.chunkSize` configuration file setting and
  :option:`--chunkSize` command-line option

- :setting:`sharding.autoSplit` configuration file setting and
  :option:`--noAutoSplit` command line option

Removal of Support for SCCC Config Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.3.x sharded clusters no longer support the use of mirrored (SCCC)
:program:`mongod` instances as config servers. The use of SCCC config
servers, deprecated in the 3.2 release, is no longer valid. Instead,
deploy your config servers as a replica set (CSRS).

To upgrade your config servers from SCCC to CSRS, see
:doc:`/tutorial/upgrade-config-servers-to-replica-set`.

Deprecated Methods and Commands
-------------------------------

Mongodb 3.3.x deprecates the following commands and :program:`mongo`
shell methods:

- :dbcommand:`group` command and :method:`db.collection.group()`.
  Use :method:`db.collection.aggregate()` or
  :method:`db.collection.mapReduce()` instead.
