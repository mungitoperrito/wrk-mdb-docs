Sharded Cluster
---------------

Membership Awareness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in 3.3.x, sharded cluster components (shards, config servers,
:program:`mongos` instances) recognize their membership in a sharded
cluster, including the name of the sharded cluster, the location of the
config servers.

To support this awareness:

- ``shardsvr`` Requirement
     For a 3.3.x sharded cluster, :program:`mongod` instances for the
     shards **must** explicitly specify its role as a ``shardsvr``,
     either via the configuration file setting
     :setting:`sharding.clusterRole` or via the command line option
     :option:`--shardsvr`.

     .. note::

        Default port for :program:`mongod` instances with the ``shardsvr``
        role is ``27018``. To use a different port, specify
        :setting:`net.port` setting or ``--port`` option.

     .. COMMENT To DOCS TEAM: Ensure that in all our sharding tutorials we specify shardsvr.

- 3.3.x ``mongos`` Incompatibility with Earlier Versions of ``mongod``
   Version 3.3.x :program:`mongos` instances cannot connect to
   earlier versions of :program:`mongod` instances.

Balancer on Config Server Primary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The balancer process has moved from the :program:`mongos` to the
primary member of the config server replica set. Associated with this
change, MongoDB 3.3.x removes the following configuration options from
the :program:`mongos`:

- :setting:`sharding.chunkSize` configuration file setting and
  :option:`--chunkSize` command-line option

- :setting:`sharding.autoSplit` configuration file setting and
  :option:`--noAutoSplit` command line option

Removal of Support for SCCC Config Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.3.x sharded clusters no longer support the use of mirrored (SCCC)
:program:`mongod` instances as config servers. The use of SCCC config
servers, deprecated in the 3.2 release, is no longer valid. Instead,
deploy your config servers as a replica set (CSRS).

To upgrade your config servers from SCCC to CSRS, see
:doc:`/tutorial/upgrade-config-servers-to-replica-set`.

.. COMMENT TO DOCS TEAM: in 3.4 manual, need to remove instances wehre we blurb about setting up SCCC.  Instead should point users to earlier versions of manual.  

.. _3.4-rel-notes-aggregation-cluster:

Aggregation
-----------

New Aggregation Stage for Recursive Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.3.x introduces a stage to the :doc:`aggregation pipeline
</core/aggregation-pipeline>` that allows for recursive search.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Stage
     - Description

   * - :pipeline:`$graphLookup`

     - Performs a recursive search on a collection. To each output
       document, adds a new array field that contains the traversal
       results of the recursive search for that document.

New Aggregation Stages for Faceted Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Faceted search allows for the categorization of documents into
classifications. For example, given a collection of inventory
documents, you may want to classify items by a single category, such as
by the price range, or by multiple categories, such as by price range
as well as separately by the departments.

3.3.x introduces stages to the :doc:`aggregation pipeline
</core/aggregation-pipeline>` that allow for faceted search.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Stage
     - Description

   * - :pipeline:`$bucket`

     - Categorizes or groups incoming documents into buckets that
       represent a range of values for a specified expression.

   * - :pipeline:`$bucketAuto`

     - Categorizes or groups incoming documents into specified number
       of buckets that represent a range of values for a specified
       expression. MongoDB automatically determines the bucket
       boundaries.

   * - :pipeline:`$facet`

     - Processes multiple :ref:`pipelines <aggregation-pipeline>` on
       the input documents and outputs a document that contains the
       results of these pipelines. By specifying facet-related stages
       (:pipeline:`$bucket`, :pipeline:`$bucketAuto`, and
       :pipeline:`$sortByCount`) in these pipelines, :pipeline:`$facet`
       allows for multi-faceted search.

   * - :pipeline:`$sortByCount`

     - Categorizes or groups incoming documents by a specified
       expression to compute the count for each group. Output documents
       are sorted in descending order by the count.

New Aggregation Array Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Operator
     - Description
     
   * - :expression:`$in`

     - Returns a boolean that indicates if a specified value is in an
       array.

   * - :expression:`$indexOfArray`

     - Searches an array for an occurence of a specified value and
       returns the array index (zero-based) of the first occurence.

   * - :expression:`$range`

     - Returns an array whose elements are a generated sequence of
       numbers.

   * - :expression:`$reverseArray`

     - Returns an output array whose elements are those of the input
       array but in reverse order.

   * - :expression:`$reduce`

     - Takes an array as input and applies an expression to each
       element in the array to return the final result of the
       expression.

   * - :expression:`$zip`

     - Returns an output array where each element is itself an array,
       consisting of elements in the corresponding array index position
       from the input arrays.

New Aggregation String Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Operator
     - Description
     
   * - :expression:`$indexOfBytes`

     - Searches a string for an occurence of a substring and returns
       the UTF-8 byte index (zero-based) of the first occurence.

   * - :expression:`$indexOfCP`

     - Searches a string for an occurence of a substring and returns
       the UTF-8 `code point
       <http://www.unicode.org/glossary/#code_point>`_ index
       (zero-based) of the first occurence.

   * - :expression:`$split`

     - Splits a string by a specified delimiter into string components
       and returns an array of the string components.


   * - :expression:`$strLenBytes`

   * - :expression:`$strLenCP`

     - Returns the number of UTF-8 `code points
       <http://www.unicode.org/glossary/#code_point>`_ for a string.

   * - :expression:`$substrBytes`

     - Returns the substring of a string. The substring starts with the
       character at the specified UTF-8 byte index (zero-based) in the
       string for the length specified.

   * - :expression:`$substrCP`

     - Returns the substring of a string. The substring starts with the
       character at the specified UTF-8 `code point
       <http://www.unicode.org/glossary/#code_point>`_ index
       (zero-based) in the string for the length specified.

New Aggregation Control Flow Expression

   * - :expression:`$isoWeekYear`

     - Returns the ISO 8601 year number, where the year starts with the
       Monday of week 1 (ISO 8601) and ends with the Sundays of the
       last week (ISO 8601).

New Type Operator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

output document. Previously, you could only exclude the ``_id`` field
in the stage. If you specify the exclusion of a field or fields, 

- All other fields are returned in the output documents.

- You cannot specify new fields or the inclusion of other fields.


Collation and Case-Insensitive Indexes
--------------------------------------

To allow for language-specific rules for string comparison, MongoDB
3.3.x introduces :ref:`collation <collation>` to its query language and
indexes.

For details, see :ref:`Collation <collation>`.

.. _3.4-relnotes-views:

Views
-----

MongoDB 3.3.x adds support for creating read-only views from existing
collections or other views. To specify or define a view, MongoDB 3.3.x
introduces:

- the ``viewOn`` and ``pipeline`` options to the existing
  :dbcommand:`create` command:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.runCommand( { create: <view>, viewOn: <source>, pipeline: <pipeline> } )

- and a corresponding :program:`mongo` shell helper
  :method:`db.createView()`:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.createView(<view>, <source>, <pipeline>)

For more information on creating views, see :ref:`3.4-reference-views`.

General Enhancements
--------------------

MongoDB 3.3.x includes the following enhancements:

- Added ``systemd`` support in distributions.

- Increased :parameter:`diagnosticDataCollectionDirectorySizeMB`
  default size to 200 megabytes from 100 megabytes.

Changes Affecting Compatibility
-------------------------------

Some changes can affect compatibility and may require user actions. For
a detailed list of compatibility changes, see
:doc:`/release-notes/3.3-dev-series-compatibility`.
