    Starting in MongoDB 7.0, binary downgrades are no longer supported for 
    MongoDB Community Edition. 

Starting in MongoDB 7.0, if you downgrade your deployment's {+fcv+}, you cannot 
downgrade your deployment's binary version without assistance from support.

To downgrade from |newversion| to |oldversion|, please `submit a request 
<https://support.mongodb.com/>`_ or contact your technical support 
representative.
