.. |downgrading| replace:: downgrading

Create Backup

*Optional but Recommended.*  Create a backup of your database.

Access Control

If your deployment has access control enabled, your downgrade user
privileges must include privileges to list and manage indexes across
databases. A user with :authrole:`root` role has the required privileges.
      
Prerequisites

To downgrade from |newversion| to |oldversion|, you must remove
incompatible features that are persisted and/or update incompatible
configuration settings. These include:

.. |target| replace:: :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance

1. Downgrade Feature Compatibility Version (fCV)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To downgrade the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` of your sharded
cluster:

#. Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the |target|.

#. .. include:: /includes/4.4-downgrade-fcv.rst

2. Remove FCV |newversion| Persisted Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following steps are necessary only if fCV has ever been set to
|newfcv|.

Remove all persisted |newversion| |features| that are incompatible with
|oldversion|. These include:

.. |binary| replace:: the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance

Procedure
---------
