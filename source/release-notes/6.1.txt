Regular Expressions
-------------------

The following sections describe changes to regular expressions in
MongoDB 6.1.

PCRE Library Upgrade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+pcre+} ({+pcre-abbr+}) is the library used by MongoDB to implement
regular expression pattern matching. Starting in version 6.1, MongoDB
upgrades the {+pcre-abbr+} library to PCRE2. PCRE2 is the current
{+pcre-abbr+} library and is actively maintained and updated.

To learn how to perform regex matches in MongoDB, see the following
pages:

- :query:`$regex` (query operator)
- :expression:`$regexFind` (aggregation operator)
- :expression:`$regexFindAll` (aggregation operator)
- :expression:`$regexMatch` (aggregation operator)

``*UCP`` Regex Option to Match Non-ASCII Characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 6.1, you can use the ``*UCP`` option for regex
queries. The ``*UCP`` option matches non-ASCII characters (specifically,
the option can match UTF-8 characters). However, the ``*UCP`` option
results in a slower query than one without the option specified.

For an example that uses the ``*UCP`` option, see
:ref:`regex-example-pcre2-ucp`.


General Changes
---------------

``connPoolStats`` Metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 6.1, the :dbcommand:`connPoolStats` command has
these output changes:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 50

   * - Document
     - Field(s)

   * - New :data:`connPoolStats.acquisitionWaitTimes` document that
       reports the wait times for requests to acquire a connection from
       :binary:`~bin.mongos` to :binary:`~bin.mongod`. 
     - New fields:

       - Time ranges with the number of connection requests in each
         range.
       - Total number of connection requests for all time ranges.

``serverStatus`` Metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 6.1, the :dbcommand:`serverStatus` command and the
:method:`db.serverStatus()` method have these output changes:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 50

   * - Document
     - Field(s)

   * - New :serverstatus:`network.listenerProcessingTime` document that
       reports the time the database listener spends allocating
       incoming database connection requests.
     - New field:

       - :serverstatus:`network.listenerProcessingTime.durationMicros`

   * - Addition to :serverstatus:`connections` document.
     - New field that reports the number of incoming connections the
       server has rejected.

       - :serverstatus:`connections.rejected`
