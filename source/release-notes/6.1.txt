Regular Expressions
-------------------

The following sections describe changes to regular expressions in
MongoDB 6.1.

PCRE Library Upgrade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+pcre+} ({+pcre-abbr+}) is the library used by MongoDB to implement
regular expression pattern matching. Starting in version 6.1, MongoDB
upgrades the {+pcre-abbr+} library to PCRE2. PCRE2 is the current
{+pcre-abbr+} library and is actively maintained and updated.

To learn how to perform regex matches in MongoDB, see the following
pages:

- :query:`$regex` (query operator)
- :expression:`$regexFind` (aggregation operator)
- :expression:`$regexFindAll` (aggregation operator)
- :expression:`$regexMatch` (aggregation operator)

``*UCP`` Regex Option to Match Non-ASCII Characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 6.1, you can use the ``*UCP`` option for regex
queries. The ``*UCP`` option matches non-ASCII characters (specifically,
the option can match UTF-8 characters). However, the ``*UCP`` option
results in a slower query than one without the option specified.

For an example that uses the ``*UCP`` option, see
:ref:`regex-example-pcre2-ucp`.


General Changes
---------------

Balancing Policy Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 6.1, data in sharded clusters is distributed based on data 
size rather than number of chunks. As a result, you should be aware of the
following significant changes in sharded cluster data distribution behavior:

- The balancer distributes ranges of data rather than chunks. The balancing 
  policy looks for evenness of data distribution rather than chunk distribution.

- Chunks are not subject to auto-splitting. Instead, chunks are split only when
  moved across shards. 

- A chunk is now referred to as a range. 

- ``moveRange`` has replaced ``moveChunk``. 

Changes to Journaling

Improved Efficiency for Multiple Document Deletions

Storage Engine

Server Parameters
-----------------

Starting in MongoDB 6.1, MongoDB adds the following new parameters:

- :parameter:`temporarilyUnavailableBackoffBaseMs` adjusts the time
  between retries after a write failure. 
- :parameter:`temporarilyUnavailableMaxRetries` limits the number of
  retries after a write failure.
