The following page summarizes various considerations for downgrading to
|oldversion|. For specific instructions for your deployment type, see:

Downgrade Path

Create Backup
-------------

*Optional but Recommended.*  Create a backup of your database.

Downgrade Feature Compatibility Version (fCV)
---------------------------------------------

Before downgrading the binaries, you must downgrade the
``featureCompatibilityVersion`` (fCV) to "4.0". For specific
instructions to downgrade the fCV, see:

- :doc:`/release-notes/4.2-downgrade-standalone`.

- :doc:`/release-notes/4.2-downgrade-replica-set`.

- :doc:`/release-notes/4.2-downgrade-sharded-cluster`.

Remove Backwards Incompatible Features
---------------------------------------

Before downgrading the binaries, remove all persisted 4.2 features that
are :ref:`incompatible with 4.0 <4.2-compatibility-enabled>`.

This section provides a summary. For detailed instructions appropriate
for your deployment type, see:

- :doc:`/release-notes/4.2-downgrade-standalone`.

- :doc:`/release-notes/4.2-downgrade-replica-set`.

- :doc:`/release-notes/4.2-downgrade-sharded-cluster`.

.. _4.2-downgrade-unique-index:

Unique Index Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container::

   For ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` (fCV) set to ``"4.2"``, MongoDB
   uses a new internal format for unique indexes that is incompatible
   with 4.0. The new format applies to both existing unique indexes as
   well as newly created/rebuilt unique indexes. Before downgrading the
   binaries, drop and recreate all unique indexes.

   For detailed instructions appropriate for your deployment type, see:

   - :doc:`/release-notes/4.2-downgrade-standalone`.

   - :doc:`/release-notes/4.2-downgrade-replica-set`.

   - :doc:`/release-notes/4.2-downgrade-sharded-cluster`.


Index Key Size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container::

   Starting in MongoDB 4.2, for ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` (fCV)
   set to ``"4.2"`` or greater, MongoDB removes the :limit:`Index Key
   Limit`. For fCV set to ``"4.0"``, the limit still applies.

   If you have an index with a name that exceeds the :limit:`Index Name
   Length` once fCV is set to ``"4.0"``,
   drop and recreate the index with a shorter name.

   For detailed instructions appropriate for your deployment type, see:

   - :doc:`/release-notes/4.2-downgrade-standalone`.

   - :doc:`/release-notes/4.2-downgrade-replica-set`.

   - :doc:`/release-notes/4.2-downgrade-sharded-cluster`.

Index Name Length
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container::

   Starting in MongoDB 4.2, for ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` (fCV)
   set to ``"4.2"`` or greater, MongoDB removes the :limit:`Index Key
   Limit`. For fCV set to ``"4.0"``, the limit still applies.

   If you have an index with a name that exceeds the :limit:`Index Name
   Length` once fCV is set to ``"4.0"``,
   drop and recreate the index with a shorter name.
