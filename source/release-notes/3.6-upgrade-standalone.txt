Default Bind to Localhost
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 3.6, :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos`
instances bind to localhost by default. Remote clients cannot connect
to an instance bound only to localhost. To override and bind to other
ip addresses, use the :setting:`net.bindIp` configuration file setting
or the ``--bind_ip`` command-line option to specify a list of ip
addresses.

The upgrade process will require that you specify the
:setting:`net.bindIp` setting if you wish remote clients to connect to
your instance.

Prerequisites
-------------

The |oldversion| instance must have ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` set
to ``3.4``.

Download |newversion| Binaries
------------------------------

Via Package Manager
