==============================================
Compatibility Changes in 3.4 Release Candidate
==============================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. include:: /includes/3.4.rst

See also :doc:`/release-notes/3.4`.

Sharded Cluster Changes
-----------------------

.. COMMENT to docs:  this section can be singlesourced since we refer to it in both rel notes and compatibility page (figured these changes are significant enought to place in both places)

``shardsvr`` Requirement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a 3.4 sharded cluster, :program:`mongod` instances for the
shards **must** explicitly specify its role as a ``shardsvr``,
either via the configuration file setting
:setting:`sharding.clusterRole` or via the command line option
:option:`--shardsvr`.

.. note::

   Default port for :program:`mongod` instances with the ``shardsvr``
   role is ``27018``. To use a different port, specify
   :setting:`net.port` setting or ``--port`` option.

.. COMMENT To DOCS TEAM: Ensure that in all our sharding tutorials we specify shardsvr.

3.4 ``mongos`` and Earlier Versions of ``mongod``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Version 3.4 :program:`mongos` instances cannot connect to earlier
versions of :program:`mongod` instances.

Removal for Configuration Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 3.4 removes the following configuration options from
the :program:`mongos`:

- ``sharding.chunkSize`` configuration file setting and
  :option:`--chunkSize` command-line option

- ``sharding.autoSplit`` configuration file setting and
  :option:`--noAutoSplit` command line option

Removal of Support for SCCC Config Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.4 sharded clusters no longer support the use of mirrored (SCCC)
:program:`mongod` instances as config servers. The use of SCCC config
servers, deprecated in the 3.2 release, is no longer valid. Instead,
deploy your config servers as a replica set (CSRS).

To upgrade your sharded cluster to version 3.4, the config servers must
be running as a replica set.

To convert your existing config servers from SCCC to CSRS, see
:doc:`/tutorial/upgrade-config-servers-to-replica-set`.

.. _3.4-compatibility-deprecated:

Deprecated Operations
---------------------

.. _group-deprecation:

``group``
~~~~~~~~~

Mongodb 3.4 deprecates the following commands and :program:`mongo`
shell methods:

- :dbcommand:`group` command and :method:`db.collection.group()`.
  Use :method:`db.collection.aggregate()` or
  :method:`db.collection.mapReduce()` instead.

.. _aggregate-wo-cursor-deprecation:

``aggregate`` without ``cursor``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/deprecation-aggregate-wo-cursor.rst

.. _3.4-general-compatibility:

General Compatibility Changes
-----------------------------

- Removal of deprecated ``textSearchEnabled`` parameter. Starting from
  version 2.6, MongoDB enables the text search feature by default.


.. _3.4-driver-compatibility:

Driver Compatibility Changes
----------------------------

To use the various new features such as the new :ref:`3.4-decimal` and
:ref:`collation` with a MongoDB driver, an upgrade to a driver version
that supports these features is necessary.
