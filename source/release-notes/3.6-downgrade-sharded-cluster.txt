Before you attempt any downgrade, familiarize yourself with the content
of this document.

Downgrade Path
--------------

.. include:: /includes/3.6-downgrade-path.rst

.. |downgrading| replace:: downgrading

Create Backup
-------------

*Optional but Recommended.*  Create a backup of your database.

Considerations
--------------

While the downgrade is in progress, you cannot make changes to the
collection metadata. For example, during the downgrade, do
**not** do any of the following:

- :method:`sh.enableSharding()`

- :method:`sh.shardCollection()`

- :method:`sh.addShard()`

- :method:`db.createCollection()`

- :method:`db.collection.drop()`

- :method:`db.dropDatabase()`

- any operation that creates a database

- any other operation that modifies the cluster meta-data in any
  way. See :doc:`/reference/sharding` for a complete list of
  sharding commands. Note, however, that not all commands on the
  :doc:`/reference/sharding` page modify the cluster meta-data.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before downgrading the binaries, you must downgrade the feature
compatibility version and remove any |newversion| features :ref:`incompatible
<3.6-compatibility-enabled>` with |oldversion| or earlier versions as outlined
below. These steps are necessary only if
``featureCompatibilityVersion`` has ever been set to ``"3.6"``.

.. |target| replace:: :program:`mongos` instance

.. _3.6-downgrade-feature-compatibility-sharded-cluster:

1. Downgrade Feature Compatibility Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Connect a :program:`mongo` shell to the |target|.

#. .. include:: /includes/3.6-downgrade-fcv.rst

2. Remove ``jsonSchema`` from Document Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
If you have defined any document validator using the
:query:`$jsonSchema`, use :dbcommand:`collMod` command to replace the
document validator.

Procedure
---------

.. warning::

   Before proceding with the downgrade procedure, ensure that all
   members, including delayed replica set members in the sharded
   cluster, reflect the prerequisite changes.
