This page describes changes introduced in MongoDB 7.0 that can affect
compatibility with older versions of MongoDB.

Queryable Encryption General Availability
-----------------------------------------

Starting in MongoDB 7.0, the {+qe-equality-ga+} is generally
available (GA). Improvements in the GA make it
incompatible with the {+qe-preview+}.

Driver Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use the {+qe-equality-ga+}, MongoDB server and drivers must both be
version 7.0 or later. If you are still using the {+qe-preview+} included
with MongoDB 6.x, both the server and drivers must remain on version
6.x. You cannot use MongoDB 6.x drivers with a 7.0 server, or 7.0
drivers with a 6.x server.

To make upgrading easier, MongoDB 7.0 drivers can decrypt data
created with MongoDB 6.x drivers. See the following section for
migration steps if you need to upgrade and then carry over existing
encrypted data.

On-Disk Storage Format Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The on-disk storage format in the {+qe-framework+} GA is
incompatible with the format used for the {+qe-preview+}. MongoDB 7.0
drivers can decrypt documents created with MongoDB 6.x drivers, but
can't query encrypted fields or insert data.

If you encrypted data using the {+qe-preview+}:

#. Upgrade MongoDB server and drivers to 7.0
#. Query each encrypted collection from a 7.0 driver to decrypt it. 
#. Save the output locally. 
#. Configure a new encrypted collection and ingest the data.

.. warning::
   * The :binary:`~bin.mongoexport` and :binary:`~bin.mongodump` 
     operations do not decrypt the collection. You must query the 
     collection from a driver to output the decrypted data. 
   * MongoDB 7.0 drivers can't query encrypted fields on data encrypted 
     with MongoDB 6.x drivers, so you must query the entire collection.
