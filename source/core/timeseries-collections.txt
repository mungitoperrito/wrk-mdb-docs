Time series data is a sequence of data points in which insights are
gained by analyzing changes over time.

Time series data is generally composed of these components:

- **Time** when the data point was recorded.

- **metadata** (sometimes referred to as source), which is a label or
  tag that identifies a data series and rarely changes. Metadata is
  stored in a metaField. You cannot add metaFields to time series
  documents after you create them. For more information on metaField
  behavior and selection, see :ref:`timeseries-collections-metafield`.

- **Measurements** (sometimes referred to as metrics or values), which
  are the data points tracked at increments in time. Generally these are
  key-value pairs that change over time.

This table shows examples of time series data:

For efficient time series data storage, MongoDB provides time series
collections.

.. _manual-timeseries-collection:

Time Series Collections
-----------------------

.. versionadded:: 5.0

Time series collections efficiently store time series data. In time
series collections, writes are organized so that data from the same
source is stored alongside other data points from a similar point in
time.

Benefits
~~~~~~~~

Compared to normal collections, storing time series data in time series
collections improves query efficiency and reduces the disk usage for
time series data and :term:`secondary indexes <secondary index>`.
MongoDB 6.3 and later automatically creates a :ref:`compound index
<index-type-compound>` on the time and metadata
fields for new time series collections. 

Time series collections use an underlying columnar storage format and
store data in time-order. This format provides the following benefits:

- Reduced complexity for working with time series data
- Improved query efficiency
- Reduced disk usage
- Reduced I/O for read operations
- Increased WiredTiger cache usage

Behavior
~~~~~~~~

Time series collections generally behave like other MongoDB collections.
You insert and query data as usual. 

.. warning::

   Match expressions in update and delete commands can only specify the
   metaField. You can't update other fields in a time series document.
   For more details, see :ref:`Time Series Delete and Update Limitations
   <timeseries-limitations-updates-deletes>`. 
   

MongoDB treats time series collections as writable non-materialized
:ref:`views <views-landing-page>` backed by an internal collection. When
you insert data, the internal collection automatically organizes time
series data into an optimized storage format. 

Starting in MongoDB 6.3: if you create a new time series collection,
MongoDB also generates a :ref:`compound index <index-create-compound>`
on the :ref:`metaField and timeField <time-series-fields>` fields. To
improve query performance, queries on time series collections use the
new compound index. The compound index also uses the optimized storage
format.

.. tip::

   To improve query performance, you can manually :ref:`add secondary
   indexes <timeseries-add-secondary-index>` on measurement fields or
   any field in your time series collection.

   .. include:: /includes/downgrade-for-timeseries-collections.rst

.. include:: /includes/database-profiler-note.rst

.. include:: /includes/time-series/timeseries-timeField-deprecated.rst

Also, starting in MongoDB 8.0, if you create a time series collection
with a shard key containing the ``timeField``, a :ref:`log message
<log-messages-ref>` is added to the :ref:`log file
<log-message-destinations>` on the :ref:`primary shard <primary-shard>`.
In addition, a log message is added every 12 hours on the primary node
of the :ref:`config server replica set <csrs>`. The log messages state
that using the ``timeField`` as a shard key in a time series collection
is deprecated and you must reshard your collection using the
``metaField``.

.. _timeseries-collections-metafield:

metaFields
~~~~~~~~~~

Time series documents can contain a metaField with metadata about each
document. MongoDB uses the metaField to group sets of
documents, both for internal storage optimization and query efficiency.
For more information about the metaField, see :ref:`metaField
Considerations <timeseries-metafield-considerations>`. 

Indexes
~~~~~~~

MongoDB automatically creates a :ref:`compound index
<index-type-compound>` on both the metaField and timeField of a time
series collection.
