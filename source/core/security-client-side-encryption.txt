The official MongoDB 4.2-compatible drivers provide a client-side field
level encryption framework. Applications can encrypt fields in documents
*prior* to transmitting data over the wire to the server. Only
applications with access to the correct encryption keys can decrypt and
read the protected data. Deleting an encryption key renders all data
encrypted using that key as permanently unreadable.

For example, a MongoDB cluster enforcing 
:ref:`authentication <authentication>` uses 
:ref:`TLS encryption <transport-encryption>` to protect data in transit.
The cluster also uses the 
:ref:`MongoDB encrypted storage engine <encrypted-storage-engine>` to
secure data on disk. Consider the following scenarios:

- An employee has administrative access to the cluster and its host 
  machines. The employee's access level allows them to view 
  high-sensitivity data in a decrypted state as part of their normal 
  duties.

- A third-party provider hosts the MongoDB cluster. The provider
  has a host-machine or database-level security breach where 
  unauthorized parties access the data in a decrypted state.

- A third-party data analytics firm has access to data that includes
  private, personal, or confidential information. The third-party
  firm loads the decrypted data into an unsecured data storage volume 
  which unauthorized parties can access.

With each scenario, a user with privileged access to either the MongoDB
cluster or a host machine can bypass encryption and read data that is
private, privileged, or confidential. Using client-side field level
encryption to protect data *prior* to being written to the server
mitigates the risk of exposing that data in the event network or disk
encryption is bypassed.

Consider the following document:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "name" : "John Doe",
     "address" : {
       "street" : "1234 Main Street",
       "city" : "MongoDBVille",
       "zip" : 99999
     },
     "phone" : "949-555-1212",
     "ssn" : "123-45-6789"
   }

With client-side field level encryption, the application can 
specifically encrypt sensitive information like the ``ssn``
and ``phone``. Encrypted fields are stored as
:bsontype:`binary data <data_binary>` with 
`subtype 6 <https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/client-side-encryption/subtype6.rst>`_:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "name" : "John Doe",
     "address" : {
       "street" : "1234 Main Street",
       "city" : "MongoDBVille",
       "zip" : 99999
     },
     "phone" : BinData(6,"U2FsdGVkX1+CGIDGUnGgtS46+c7R5u17SwPDEmzyCbA="),
     "ssn" : BinData(6,"AaloEw285E3AnfjP+r8ph2YCvMI1+rWzpZK97tV6iz0jx")
   }

See the :ecosystem:`Client Side Field Level Encryption Guide
</use-cases/client-side-field-level-encryption-guide/>` for an
end-to-end procedure for configuring field level encryption using select
MongoDB 4.2-compatible drivers.

MongoDB supports two methods of client-side field level encryption using
the official MongoDB 4.2-compatible drivers:

Explicit (manual) encryption of fields
  MongoDB 4.2-compatible drivers support explicitly encrypting
  or decrypting fields with a specific data key and encryption
  algorithm.

  Applications must modify any code associated with constructing read
  and write operations to include encryption/decryption logic via the
  driver encryption library. Applications are responsible for selecting
  the appropriate data key for encryption/decryption on a per-operation
  basis.

  The 4.2 :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell provides the following methods for 
  performing explicit encryption and decryption:

  - :method:`getClientEncryption()`
  - :method:`ClientEncryption.encrypt()`
  - :method:`ClientEncryption.decrypt()`

  For more information, see
  :doc:`/core/security-explicit-client-side-encryption`.

Automatic encryption of fields
  .. include:: /includes/extracts/csfle-enterprise-atlas-only.rst

  MongoDB 4.2 Enterprise extends 4.2-compatible driver encryption
  support to include :ref:`automatic field level encryption
  <field-level-encryption-automatic>` using :ref:`JSON schema syntax
  <field-level-encryption-json-schema>`.
  
  Applications must modify only the driver client object configuration
  code to include automatic encryption settings. All read/write
  operations to a cluster via the encryption-configured client are
  automatically encrypted and decrypted using the predefined automatic
  encryption rules. Code associated with constructing read and write
  operations does not require additional modification.

  For more information, see
  :doc:`/core/security-automatic-client-side-encryption`.

MongoDB 4.2-compatible drivers and the 4.2 :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
automatically decrypt :bsontype:`Binary` subtype 6 objects created using
client-side field level encryption. For more information on automatic
decryption, see :ref:`field-level-encryption-automatic-decryption`.

.. important::

   MongoDB client-side field level encryption only supports encrypting
   single fields in a document. To encrypt an entire document, you must
   encrypt each individual field in the document. 

Encryption Components
---------------------

The following diagram illustrates the relationships between the
driver and each encryption component:

.. figure:: /images/client-side-field-level-encryption-diagram.svg
   :alt: Diagram of relationships between driver and encryption components
   :figwidth: 600px

- ``libmongocrypt`` is the `Apache-licensed open-source
  <https://github.com/mongodb/libmongocrypt>`__ core cryptography
  library used by the official MongoDB 4.2-compatible drivers and the
  :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell for powering client-side field level
  encryption. Some drivers may require specific integration steps to
  install or link the library. Defer to driver documentation for more
  complete information.

- :ref:`mongocryptd` supports :ref:`field-level-encryption-automatic`
  and is only available with MongoDB Enterprise. ``mongocryptd`` does
  not perform cryptographic functions.

- The key vault is a MongoDB collection that stores all data encryption
  keys used to encrypt values. Data encryption keys are themselves
  encrypted using a Customer Master Key (CMK) prior to storage in the
  collection. The key vault may reside on a different MongoDB cluster
  than the one storing the encrypted data. See
  :ref:`field-level-encryption-keyvault` for more information.

- The Key Management System stores the Customer Master Key used to
  encrypt data encryption keys. See :ref:`field-level-encryption-kms`
  for more information.

- The MongoDB cluster which stores the encrypted data may also
  enforce client-side field level encryption. See
  :ref:`field-level-encryption-enforce-schema` for more information. 

.. _field-level-encryption-algorithms:

Encryption Algorithms
---------------------

MongoDB client-side field level encryption uses the encrypt-then-MAC
approach combined with either a deterministic or random initialization
vector to encrypt field values. MongoDB *only* supports the 
`AEAD <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authenticated_encryption&oldid=925133676>`__ 
AES-256-CBC encryption algorithm with HMAC-SHA-512 MAC. 

.. _field-level-encryption-deterministic:

Deterministic Encryption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The deterministic encryption algorithm ensures a given input value
*always* encrypts to the same output value each time the algorithm is
executed. While deterministic encryption provides greater support for
read operations, encrypted data with low cardinality is susceptible to
frequency analysis recovery.

For sensitive fields that are *not* used in read operations,
applications may use :ref:`field-level-encryption-random` for improved
protection from frequency analysis recovery.

.. _field-level-encryption-random:

Random Encryption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The random encryption algorithm ensures that a given input value
*always* encrypts to a different output value each time the algorithm is
executed. While random encryption provides the strongest guarantees of
data confidentiality, it also prevents support for any read operations
which must operate on the encrypted field to evaluate the query.

Random encryption also supports encrypting entire objects or arrays. For
example, consider the following document:

.. code-block:: json

   {
    "personal_information" : {
      "ssn" : "123-45-6789",
      "credit_score" : 750,
      "credit_cards" : [ "1234-5678-9012-3456", "9876-5432-1098-7654"]
    },
    "phone_numbers" : [ "(212) 555-0153" ]
   }

Encrypting the ``personal_information`` and ``phone_numbers`` fields
using the random encryption algorithm encrypts the *entire* object.
While this protects all fields nested under those fields, it also
prevents querying against those nested fields. 

For sensitive fields that *are* used in read operations, applications
must use :ref:`field-level-encryption-deterministic` for improved read
support on encrypted fields.

.. _field-level-encryption-automatic-decryption:

Automatic Field Decryption
--------------------------

The :bsontype:`BinData <Binary>` blob metadata includes the data key
``_id`` and encryption algorithm used to encrypt the binary data. The
4.2-compatible drivers and 4.2 :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell use this
metadata to attempt automatic decryption ``BinData`` type 6 values. The
automatic decryption process works as follows:

1. Check the :bsontype:`BinData <Binary>` blob metadata for the
   the data key and encryption algorithm used to encrypt the value.

#. Check the key vault configured in the current database connection for
   the specified data key. If the key vault does not contain the 
   specified key, automatic decryption fails and the driver returns
   the ``BinData`` blob.
   
#. Check the data key metadata for the Customer Master Key used
   to encrypt the key material. 

#. For the Amazon Web Services KMS, send the data key to the
   KMS service for decryption. If the CMK does not exist *or* if the
   connection configuration does not grant access to the CMK, 
   decryption fails and the driver returns the ``BinData`` blob.

   For the Locally Managed Key, retrieve the local key and decrypt
   the data key. If the local key specified in the database
   configuration was not used to encrypt the data key, decryption
   fails and the driver returns the ``BinData`` blob.

#. Decrypt the :bsontype:`BinData <Binary>` value using the decrypted
   data key and appropriate algorithm.

Applications with access to the MongoDB server that do not *also* have
access to the required master key and data encryption keys cannot
decrypt the ``BinData`` values.

For more information on configuring the database connection for
client-side field level encryption, see the :method:`Mongo()`
constructor *or* defer to the documentation for your preferred driver's
client construction method.

.. _field-level-encryption-enforce-schema:

Enforce Field Level Encryption Schema
-------------------------------------

The MongoDB 4.2 server supports using :doc:`schema validation
</core/schema-validation>` to enforce encryption of specific fields in a
collection. Use the automatic client-side field level encryption
:ref:`JSON schema syntax <field-level-encryption-json-schema>` with the
:query:`$jsonSchema` validation object to indicate which fields require
encryption. The server rejects any write operations to that collection
where the specified fields are not :bsontype:`Binary (BinData) <binary>`
subtype 6 objects.

For example, the following :dbcommand:`collMod` command modifies
the ``hr.employees`` collection to include a ``validator``. The
:query:`$jsonSchema` validation object includes client-side field
level encryption keywords to indicate that:

- The ``taxid`` field **must** be encrypted. Clients should use the
  specified data key and the :ref:`Random
  <field-level-encryption-deterministic>` encryption algorithm when
  encrypting the field. 

- The ``taxid-short`` field **must** be encrypted. Clients should use
  the specified data key and the :ref:`Deterministic
  <field-level-encryption-deterministic>` encryption algorithm when
  encrypting the field.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getSiblingDB("hr").runCommand(
     { 
       "collMod" : "employees",
       "validator" : {
         "$jsonSchema" : {
           "bsonType" : "object",
           "properties" : {
             "taxid" : {
               "encrypt" : {
                 "keyId" : [UUID("e114f7ad-ad7a-4a68-81a7-ebcb9ea0953a")],
                 "algorithm" : "AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512-Random",
               }
             },
             "taxid-short" : {
               "encrypt" : {
                 "keyId" : [UUID("33408ee9-e499-43f9-89fe-5f8533870617")],
                 "algorithm" : "AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512-Deterministic",
                 "bsonType" : "string"
               }
             }
           }
         }
       }
     }
   )

Clients performing explicit (manual) field level encryption **must**
:method:`encrypt <ClientEncryption.encrypt()>` *at minimum* the
``taxid`` and ``taxid-short`` fields using the same settings as the
remote :query:`$jsonSchema` *prior* to issuing the write operation.

Clients performing :ref:`automatic client-side field level encryption
<field-level-encryption-json-schema>` have specific behavior depending
on the :ref:`database connection configuration
<mongo-connection-automatic-client-side-encryption-enabled>`:

.. container::

   *Automatic client-side field level encryption is available with
   MongoDB 4.2 Enterprise only.*

- If the connection :ref:`ClientSideFieldLevelEncryptionOptions`
  ``schemaMap`` object contains a key for the specified collection, the
  client uses that object to perform automatic field level encryption
  and ignores the remote schema. The local rules **must** encrypt at
  minimum those the ``taxid`` and ``taxid-short`` fields. 

- If the connection :ref:`ClientSideFieldLevelEncryptionOptions`
  ``schemaMap`` object does *not* contain a key for the specified
  collection, the client downloads the server-side remote schema for the
  collection and uses it to perform automatic field level encryption.
  
  This configuration requires the client to trust the server has a valid
  schema with respect to automatic field level encryption. The client
  only uses the remote schema to perform automatic field level
  encryption and does not enforce any other validation rules specified
  in the schema.

Since the MongoDB server cannot decrypt nor introspect the contents of
the encrypted field, it *cannot* validate that clients used the
specified encryption options to encrypt a given field. This allows two
clients to insert encrypted data using different keyIDs or encryption
algorithms for a specific field. While some workloads may require
independent field level encryption implementations, inconsistent
implementation of encryption options for a field across clients may
result in incorrect or unexpected behavior of queries against the
encrypted field.

For example, client ``A`` encrypts the ``PII`` field using random
encryption while client ``B`` encrypts the ``PII`` field using
deterministic encryption. The random encryption algorithm always returns
a different unique value while the deterministic algorithm always
returns the same value. Queries expecting deterministically encrypted
data for that field return inconsistent results, as the server cannot
match any of the randomly encrypted fields.
