``SCRAM-SHA-1`` is the default authentication mechanism for MongoDB.
``SCRAM-SHA-1`` is an IETF standard, `RFC 5802
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802>`_, that defines best practice methods for
implementation of challenge-response mechanisms for authenticating users with
passwords.

``SCRAM-SHA-1`` verifies the supplied user credentials against the user's
:data:`name <admin.system.users.user>`, :data:`password
<admin.system.users.credentials>` and :data:`authentication database
<admin.system.users.db>`. The authentication database is the database where the
user was created, and together with the user's name, serves to identify the
user.

``SCRAM-SHA-1`` Advantages
--------------------------

MongoDB's implementation of ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` represents an improvement
in security over the previously-used ``MONGODB-CR``, providing:

- A tunable work factor (``iterationCount``),
- Per-user random salts rather than server-wide salts,
- A cryptographically stronger hash function (``SHA-1`` rather than ``MD5``),
  and
- Authentication of the server to the client as well as the client to the
  server.

``SCRAM-SHA-1`` and ``MongoDB-CR`` User Credentials
---------------------------------------------------

``SCRAM-SHA-1`` is the default mechanism for MongoDB versions beginning
with the 3.0 series. However, if you are upgrading a MongoDB 2.6
instances that already have users credentials, MongoDB will continue to
use ``MONGODB-CR`` for challenge-response authentication until you
upgrade the authentication schema.

For details on upgrading the authentication schema model to
``SCRAM-SHA-1``, see :doc:`/release-notes/3.0-scram`.

Driver Support
--------------

A driver upgrade is **necessary** to use the ``SCRAM-SHA-1``
authentication mechanism if your current driver version does not
support ``SCRAM-SHA-1``.
   
The minimum driver versions that support ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` are:
