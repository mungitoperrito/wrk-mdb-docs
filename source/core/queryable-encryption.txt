Introduction
------------

{+qe+} is a feature that enables you to encrypt data in your
application before you send it over the network to MongoDB while still
maintaining the ability to query the encrypted data. With {+qe+}
enabled, no MongoDB-managed service has access to your data in an
unencrypted form.

You can set up {+qe+} using the following mechanisms:

- Automatic Encryption: Enables you to perform encrypted read and
  write operations without you having to write code to specify how to
  encrypt fields.
- {+manual-enc-title+}: Enables you to perform encrypted read and write
  operations through your MongoDB driver's encryption library. You must
  specify the logic for encryption with this library throughout your
  application.

The following table shows which MongoDB server products support which {+csfle-abbrev+}
mechanisms:
