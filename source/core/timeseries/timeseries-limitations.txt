This page describes limitations of time series collections.

Unsupported Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following features are not supported for 
:ref:`time series collections <manual-timeseries-collection>`.

* :atlas:`Atlas Search </atlas-search>`
* :doc:`Change streams </changeStreams>`
* :ref:`{+csfle+} <manual-csfle-feature>`
* :realm:`Database Triggers </triggers/database-triggers>`
* :realm:`GraphQL API </graphql>`
* :realm:`Atlas Device Sync </sync>` (Atlas Device Sync is supported if
  the time series collections are asymmetrically synchronized. For
  details, see :realm:`Enable Atlas Device Sync
  </sync/configure/enable-sync>`.)
* :dbcommand:`reIndex`
* :dbcommand:`renameCollection`
* :doc:`Schema validation rules </core/schema-validation>`

Aggregation $out and $merge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can't use aggregation pipeline stages :pipeline:`$out` and :pipeline:`$merge`
to output or merge into to :ref:`time series collections
<manual-timeseries-collection>` from another collection.

.. _timeseries-limitations-updates-deletes:

Updates and Deletes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 5.1, you can perform some delete and update
operations.

Delete commands must meet the following requirements:

- The query may only match on ``metaField`` field values.
- The delete command may not limit the number of documents to be
  deleted. You must use a delete command with ``justOne: false`` or the
  :method:`~db.collection.deleteMany()` method.

Update commands must meet the following requirements:

- The query may only match on ``metaField`` field values.
- The update command may only modify the ``metaField`` field value.
- The update must be performed with an update document that contains
  only :ref:`update operator <update-operators>` expressions.
- The update command may not limit the number of documents to be
  updated. You must use an update command with ``multi: true`` or the
  :method:`~db.collection.updateMany()` method.
- The update command may not set :ref:`upsert: true <update-upsert>`.

In MongoDB 5.0, :ref:`Time series collections
<manual-timeseries-collection>` only support insert operations and read
queries. Updates and manual delete operations result in an error.

To automatically delete old data, :ref:`set up automatic removal (TTL)
<set-up-automatic-removal>`.

To remove all documents from a collection, use the
:method:`~db.collection.drop()` method to drop the collection.

.. _timeseries-limitations-secondary-indexes:

Time Series Secondary Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Time Series Secondary Indexes with MongoDB 6.0 and Later
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Starting in MongoDB 6.0, you can add a :term:`secondary index <secondary
index>` to any field.

These index types aren't supported:

- :doc:`Text </core/index-text>`
- :doc:`2d </core/2d>`

These index properties aren't supported:

- :doc:`TTL </core/index-ttl>`. For TTL deletion, use
  :ref:`expireAfterSeconds <db.createCollection.expireAfterSeconds>`.
- :doc:`Unique </core/index-unique>`

The :doc:`multikey index </core/index-multikey>` type is allowed on the
``metaField`` only.

These index properties are partially supported:

- :doc:`Partial indexes </core/index-partial>` are allowed on all fields
  except the ``metaField`` and ``timeField``.
- :doc:`Sparse indexes </core/index-sparse>` are allowed on the
  ``metaField`` only.

For improvements to time series secondary indexes available starting in
MongoDB 6.0, see :ref:`timeseries-add-secondary-index-mongodb-6.0`.

.. include:: /includes/time-series-secondary-indexes-downgrade-FCV.rst

Time Series Secondary Indexes with MongoDB 5.0 and Earlier
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

In MongoDB 5.0 and earlier:

- Secondary indexes can only be defined on the ``metaField`` or the
  ``timeField``.
- If the ``metaField`` is a document, you can add secondary indexes on
  fields inside that document.

   :ref:`indexes`

Capped Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A time series collection can't be created as a :ref:`capped collection
<manual-capped-collection>`.

Modification of Collection Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A collection's type can only be set when creating the collection:

- An existing collection can't be converted into a :ref:`time series
  collection <manual-capped-collection>`.
- A :ref:`time series collection <manual-capped-collection>` can't be
  converted into a different collection type.

To move data from an existing collection to a time series collection,
:ref:`migrate data into a time series collection
<migrate-data-into-a-timeseries-collection>`.

Modification of ``timeField`` and ``metaField``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can only set a collection's ``timeField`` and ``metaField``
parameters when creating the collection. After creation these parameters
can't be modified.

.. _timeseries-limitations-granularity:

Modification of ``granularity``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the ``granularity`` is set it can only be increased by one level at
a time. From ``"seconds"`` to ``"minutes"`` or from ``"minutes"`` to
``"hours"``. Other changes are not allowed. If you need to change the
``granularity`` from ``"seconds"`` to ``"hours"``, first increase the
``granularity`` to ``"minutes"`` and then to ``"hours"``.

.. _time-series-limitations-sharding:

Sharding
~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 5.1 (and 5.0.6), sharded time series collections are
supported. When using sharded time series collections, you cannot modify
the ``granularity`` of a sharded time series collection.

In versions earlier than MongoDB 5.0.6, you cannot shard time series
collections.

Sharding Administration Commands
````````````````````````````````

Starting in MongoDB 5.2 (and 5.1.2, 5.0.6), you can run :ref:`sharding
administration commands <db-commands-sharding>` (such as
:dbcommand:`moveChunk`) on the ``system.buckets`` collection.

In versions earlier than MongoDB 5.0.6, you cannot run sharding
administration commands for sharded time series collections.

Shard Key Fields
````````````````

.. include:: /includes/time-series/fact-shard-key-limitations.rst

Resharding
``````````

You can't reshard sharded time series collections.

Transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can't write to :ref:`time series collections
<manual-timeseries-collection>` in :doc:`transactions
</core/transactions>`.

.. note::

  Reads from time series collections are supported in transactions.

Views
~~~~~

- Time series collections are writable non-materialized :ref:`views
  <views-landing-page>`. Limitations for views apply to time series
  collections.

- You cannot create a view from a time series bucket collection
  namespace (namely, a collection prefixed with ``system.buckets``).
