Introduction
------------

{+qe+} is a feature that enables you to encrypt data in your
application before you send it over the network to MongoDB while still
maintaining the ability to query the encrypted data. With {+qe+}
enabled, no MongoDB-managed service has access to your data in an
unencrypted form.

.. important:: Technical Preview

   MongoDB will add support for explicit encryption during the technical
   preview.
