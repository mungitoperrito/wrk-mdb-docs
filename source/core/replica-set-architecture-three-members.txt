The minimum number of replica set members needed to obtain the benefits
of a replica set is three members. A three member replica set can have
either three data-bearing members (Primary-Secondary-Secondary)
(*Recommended*) or if circumstances (such as cost) prohibit adding a
third data bearing member, two data-bearing members and an arbiter
(Primary-Secondary-Arbiter). [#arbiter-drawbacks]_

.. [#arbiter-drawbacks]

   Adding an arbiter instead of another secondary limits the redundancy
   and fault tolerance of the replica set and some operations, like the
   use of read concern "majority". See :ref:`rs-architecture-psa` for
   details.

Primary with Two Secondary Members (P-S-S)
------------------------------------------

A replica set with three members that store data has:

- One :doc:`primary </core/replica-set-primary>`.

- Two :doc:`secondary </core/replica-set-secondary>` members. Both
  secondaries can become the primary in an :doc:`election
  </core/replica-set-elections>`.

.. include:: /images/replica-set-primary-with-two-secondaries.rst

These deployments provide two complete copies of the data set at all
times in addition to the primary. These replica sets provide
additional fault tolerance and :ref:`high availability
<replica-set-failover>`. If the primary is unavailable, the replica
set elects a secondary to be primary and continues normal
operation. The old primary rejoins the set when available.

Primary with a Secondary and an Arbiter (PSA)
---------------------------------------------

.. note::

   - If you have a three-member PSA, the cache pressure will increase
     if support for "majority" read concern is enabled and any data
     bearing node is down. For more information, see
     :ref:`disable-read-concern-majority`.

A three member replica set with a two members that store data has:

- One :doc:`primary </core/replica-set-primary>`.

- One :doc:`secondary </core/replica-set-secondary>` member. The
  secondary can become primary in an :doc:`election
  </core/replica-set-elections>`.

- One :doc:`arbiter </core/replica-set-arbiter>`. The arbiter only
  votes in elections.

.. include:: /images/replica-set-primary-with-secondary-and-arbiter.rst

Since the arbiter does not hold a copy of the data, these deployments
provides only one complete copy of the data. Arbiters require fewer
resources, but at the expense of more limited redundancy and fault
tolerance.

However, a deployment with a primary, secondary, and an arbiter
ensures that a replica set remains available if the primary *or* the
secondary is unavailable. If the primary is unavailable, the replica
set will elect the secondary to be primary.
