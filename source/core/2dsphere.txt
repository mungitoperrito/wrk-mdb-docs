Overview
--------

A ``2dsphere`` index supports queries that calculate geometries on an
earth-like sphere. ``2dsphere`` index supports all MongoDB geospatial
queries: queries for inclusion, intersection and proximity. See the
:doc:`/reference/operator/query-geospatial` for the query operators
that support geospatial queries.

The ``2dsphere`` index supports data stored as :doc:`GeoJSON
</reference/geojson>` objects and as legacy coordinate pairs (See also
:ref:`2dsphere-data-restrictions`). For legacy coordinate pairs, the
index converts the data to GeoJSON :ref:`geojson-point`. For details on
the supported GeoJSON objects, see :doc:`/reference/geojson`.

The default datum for an earth-like sphere is :term:`WGS84`.
Coordinate-axis order is **longitude, latitude**.

.. _2dsphere-v2:

``2dsphere (Version 2)``
------------------------

.. versionchanged:: 2.6

MongoDB 2.6 introduces a version 2 of ``2dsphere`` indexes. Version 2
is the default version of ``2dsphere`` indexes created in MongoDB 2.6
and later series. To override the default version 2 and create a
version 1 index, include the option ``{ "2dsphereIndexVersion": 1 }``
when creating the index.

``sparse`` Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 2.6

``2dsphere (Version 2)`` indexes are :doc:`sparse </core/index-sparse>`
by default and ignores the :doc:`sparse: true </core/index-sparse>`
option. If a document lacks a ``2dsphere`` index field (or the field is
``null`` or an empty array), MongoDB does not add an entry for the
document to the index. For inserts, MongoDB inserts the document but
does not add to the ``2dsphere`` index.

For a compound index that includes a ``2dsphere`` index key along with
keys of other types, only the ``2dsphere`` index field determines
whether the index references a document.

Earlier versions of MongoDB only support ``2dsphere (Version 1)``
indexes. ``2dsphere (Version 1)`` indexes are *not* sparse by default
and will reject documents with ``null`` location fields.

Additional GeoJSON Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``2dsphere (Version 2)`` includes support for additional GeoJSON
object: :ref:`geojson-multipoint`, :ref:`geojson-multilinestring`,
:ref:`geojson-multipolygon`, and :ref:`geojson-geometrycollection`. For
details on all supported GeoJSON objects, see :doc:`/reference/geojson`.

Considerations
--------------

``geoNear`` and ``$geoNear`` Restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. |first-geo-index| replace:: ``2dsphere`` index
.. |second-geo-index| replace:: :doc:`2d </core/2d>` index
.. include:: /includes/fact-limitation-one-geo-index-per-collection.rst

Shard Key Restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You cannot use a ``2dsphere`` index as a shard key when sharding a
collection. However, you can create and maintain a geospatial index on
a sharded collection by using a different field as the shard key.

Create a ``2dsphere`` Index
---------------------------

.. include:: /includes/create-2dsphere-index.rst

Unlike a compound :doc:`2d </core/2d>` index which can reference one
location field and one other field, a :ref:`compound
<index-type-compound>` ``2dsphere`` index can reference multiple
location and non-location fields.

For the following examples, consider a collection ``places`` with
documents that store location data as :ref:`GeoJSON Point
<geojson-point>` in a field named ``loc``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.insert(
      {
         loc : { type: "Point", coordinates: [ -73.97, 40.77 ] },
         name: "Central Park",
         category : "Parks"
      }
   )

   db.places.insert(
      {
         loc : { type: "Point", coordinates: [ -73.88, 40.78 ] },
         name: "La Guardia Airport",
         category : "Airport"
      }
   )

Create a ``2dsphere`` Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operation creates a :doc:`2dsphere </core/2dsphere>`
index on the location field ``loc``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.createIndex( { loc : "2dsphere" } )

Create a Compound Index with ``2dsphere`` Index Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A :ref:`compound index <index-type-compound>` can include a
``2dsphere`` index key in combination with non-geospatial index keys.
For example, the following operation creates a compound index where
the first key ``loc`` is a ``2dsphere`` index key, and the remaining
keys ``category`` and ``names`` are non-geospatial index keys,
specifically descending (``-1``) and ascending (``1``) keys
respectively.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.createIndex( { loc : "2dsphere" , category : -1, name: 1 } )

Unlike the :doc:`2d </core/2d>` index, a compound ``2dsphere`` index
does not require the location field to be the first field indexed. For
example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.createIndex( { category : 1 , loc : "2dsphere" } )

.. class:: hidden
