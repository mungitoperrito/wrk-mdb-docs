Feature Compatibility
---------------------

The ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` of all members of the replica set
must be ``4.0`` or greater.

.. _transaction-limit:

Runtime Limit
-------------

By default, a transaction must have a runtime of less than one minute.
You can modify this limit using
:parameter:`transactionLifetimeLimitSeconds`. Transactions that exceeds
this limit are considered expired and will be aborted by a periodic
cleanup process.

Oplog Size Limit
----------------

The oplog entry for the transaction must be within the BSON document
size limit of 16MB.

WiredTiger Cache
----------------

To prevent storage cache pressure from immobilizing the system:

- When you abandon a transaction, abort the transaction.

- When you encounter an error during individual operation in the
  transaction, abort the transaction and retry the transaction.

The :parameter:`transactionLifetimeLimitSeconds` also ensures that
expired transactions are aborted periodically.
