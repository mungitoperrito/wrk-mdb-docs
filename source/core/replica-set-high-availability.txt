:term:`Replica sets <replica set>` provide high availability using
automatic :term:`failover`. Failover allows a :term:`secondary` member
to become :term:`primary` if the current primary becomes unavailable.

.. versionchanged:: 3.2

   MongoDB introduces a version 1 of the replication protocol
   (:rsconf:`protocolVersion: 1 <protocolVersion>`) to reduce replica set
   failover time and accelerates the detection of multiple simultaneous
   primaries. New replica sets will, by default, use
   :rsconf:`protocolVersion: 1 <protocolVersion>`. Previous versions of
   MongoDB use version 0 of the protocol.

Replica set members keep the same data set but are otherwise
independent. If the primary becomes unavailable, an eligible secondary
holds an :doc:`election </core/replica-set-elections>` to elect itself
as a new primary. In some situations, the failover process may undertake
a :doc:`rollback </core/replica-set-rollbacks>`. [#rollback-automatic]_

.. [#rollback-automatic] Replica sets remove "rollback" data when
   needed without intervention. Administrators must apply or discard
   rollback data manually.
